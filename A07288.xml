         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

for the moſt part either Papiſts or Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts?) yet am I of another, and I hope, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion, that theſe forenamed reaſons or anie other of that kinde, that may bee named, ought not to affray or diſcourage anie from occupying of their talents in the feare of God, as well in writing, as in preaching, ſo that thereby the one be not hindered by the other.</p>
            <p>What though there be many bookes? yet al bookes are not godly bookes. True it is, that many haue iuſtly complained of the multitude of vain &amp; wanton bookes, but neuer did I reade or heare anie godly man complaine, that there are too manye bookes tending to vertue, and godlines<hi>:</hi> nay, let mee ſaie more, what though there be a multitude of good &amp; learned books? yet we know, the moſt part of people are not learned, and as neceſſarie it is, if it bee not more neceſſarie, that the ignoranter ſort haue moebookes, compoſed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their capacities, as it is for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to haue many learned books imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to the increaſe of their knowledge. What though there be a great many that
<pb facs="tcp:13012:3"/>
will carpe and finde faulte with our well dooing? Is it not ſufficient that we haue God and a good conſcience witneſsing with vs, and comforting vs in our labors?</p>
            <p>Laſtly, if euerie circumſtance be duly weighed, ſome conuenient time ſpent in writing need not be a hindrance (as ſome pretend) but rather a furtheraunce vnto preaching: for can any write without ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying? and wil not that ſtudying help the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in preaching? Hath onely S. Auſten ſaid, <hi>Proficiendo ſcribo, &amp; ſcribendo proficio?</hi> In profiting I write, and by writing I profit?

Thus if we will duly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this matter, we ſhal ſee how theſe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall obiections to hinder men from doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt good they can in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, are but as thicke miſtes, which the Sunne beames of trueth will eaſily ſcatter and diſperſe, or like vnto bugs, to afright

little children withall, that are afraid with the ſhaddowe of anie thing. And now, (chriſtian Reader) for mine owne parte, as I haue no cauſe to vſe many wordes of perſwaſion vnto thee, for the acceptance of theſe my poore labours, ſeeing I haue (not long ſince) found more fauour that waie, than I my ſelfe did expect, or durſt to deſire, ſo I will not vſe many ſpeeches more in this preface, to hinder thee from reading the booke it ſelfe, wherin, if thou take the leaſt comfort or profite, I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my ſelfe well recompenſed for my paines.</p>
            <p>The whole booke it ſelfe is but little, and yet I haue digeſted it into ſeuerall Chapters, that thou maieſt reade the ſame with the more delight. The title of this booke is ſomewhat glorious, the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſurely godly, onely the handling of it is plaine and ſimple. The ſubſtance whereof this Chaine was made, is a met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall finer than the golde of Ophir, the workeman that by the ſpirite of God firſt riuited the links of this Chaine together, was ſuch a one, to vſe the wordes of Saint

Paule, as did ſtudie to ſhewe himſelfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of God, a workeman that need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to be aſhamed. It was Saint Peters <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.15,</note> work, therefore called S. Peters Chaine. The title, you may ſee, is not forced: the matter I haue indeuoured to handle, according to this our Apoſtles owne me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod: amplifying and inlarging the ſame, agreeable with the tenor of the ſcripture. The onely marke that I leuell at is this, firſt, that as ſathan by his ſubtiltie labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to linke many ſinnes together in one ſoule, and to draw many ſoules with him in his chaine vnto hell, ſo the godly may be as carefull to linke many vertues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, and ſo euen to tie themſelues to vertue and godlyneſſe, as with a moſt ſtrong Chaine, which all the deuils in hel may not be able to break. Againe, ſeeing we liue in theſe laſt &amp; looſe daies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Mat. 24.12</note> ſinne doth abound, and iniquitie hath gotten the vpperhande, ſeeing the whole world, as Saint Iohn ſaith, is ſet on wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednes, &amp; people drawe ſinnes vnto them <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 9.19,</note> as it were with cart-ropes, inſomuch that it ſeemeth the whole foundation of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb facs="tcp:13012:5"/>
and godlines is ſhaken, that ſo in like manner y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> godly may haue ſo many props as are poſsible, to ſtaie them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling, &amp; being knit and lincked together with this holy Chaine, they may by little and little hale and tow forwarde, one helping and ſupporting another towardes the hauen of reſt, where the tempeſtuous ſeas of ſin and iniquitie leaue raging. Salomon, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <note place="margin">Eccle. 4.12.</note> ſpeaketh of a threefolde corde, that is not eaſily broken: but heere is no cord, but a ſtrong cable, not of three, but of eight twiſts, to draw thee forward vnto heauen. This cable muſt not bee diuided into partes, for then one twiſt will breake after another, thou muſt holde by all or none. Therfore is it rightly called a <hi>Chain,</hi> becauſe one lincke muſt hold faſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Faith muſt hold Vertue, Vertue muſt keep Knowledge, Knowledge muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue Temperance, Temperance muſt ſtaie Patience, Patience muſt retain God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, Godlines muſt vpholde Brotherly kindnes, Brotherly kindneſſe muſt draw on loue or Charitie with it, &amp; Loue muſt haue recourſe backe againe vnto Faith, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:13012:5"/>
ſo the Chain is perfected. So that in deed, he that hath one of theſe lincks, hath all, &amp; he that hath not all hath none. Here is no boaſting of faith without workes: here is no reioycing in works without faith, here is no vertue without knowledge, no knowledge without temperance, no pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence without godlines, no godlines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brotherly kindnes, no kindnes among brethren without godly loue or charitie. Begin with faith, &amp; end in loue, (for faith worketh by loue) ſo ſhalt thou be ſure to haue the end of thy faith, euen the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thy ſoul, which is the thing that I hartely wiſh vnto thee &amp; me. Thus do &amp; thou ſhalt liue, thus liue, &amp; thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <note place="margin">Gal: 5.6.1. Pet. 1.9.

Is it becauſe there is no excellent or vertuous operation in it?

                  </label> But ſome happily will ſay, that faith is a ſpirituall thing that cannot be ſeene, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſenſes of our earthly bodies cannot perceiue it, but the ſoule which is the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt parte of man being alſo ſpirituall, hath not ſhe power to looke into ſuch ſecreſies? I graunt that faith is a ſpirituall thing, which cannot be ſeene with our bodily eyes, for it is the ground of things hoped for, and the euidence of things which are not ſeene. I graunt alſo, that the ſoule of man is a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">Heb. 11.1</note> and inuiſible ſubſtaunce, but yet it doth not follow that ſhe is able of her ſelfe to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſecreſies of faith, for one inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing doth not alwaies know the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of another: as for example, the deuill <note place="margin">The deuil knows not our thoghts Heb. 4.12.13.</note> who is inuiſible, doth not know the ſecrete thoughts of man which are alſo inuiſible, but only God knowes them: nothing more doth the ſoule vnderſtand the vertue and ſecrete operation of faith, except it bee firſt reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the ſpirite of God.</p>
               <p>This is proued moſt plainely by that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Saint Paul, The naturall man cannot <note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.14.</note> perceiue the things that are of God. Nowe when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the naturall man, we muſt needs confeſſe, that vnder the word man, he comprehendeth both partes of man, ſoule, and body, for the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoule is not a man, but a lumpe of fleſh, or a carkeſſe: ſo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is plaine by the words
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13012:9"/>
of Saint Paul that the ſoule of a man vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate <note place="margin">No man vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate doth know the ſecreſies of faith.</note> doeth no more know the ſecreſies of faith, and the things that are of God, then the body doth.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, if wee conſider the principall parts and powers of the ſoule, (ſince the fall of Adam) ſhall we perceiue any thing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in but meere darknes and ignorance? What is our reaſon &amp; vnderſtanding, euen of them that haue the fineſt wits, is it not meere foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhnes? Is not our knowledge blinded? Is not our freewil vtterly loſt &amp; decayed? Can we make choyce of any thing that is good? Surely no: for if the verie regenerate do but knowe in part, (as the Apoſtle ſaith) then doubtleſſe the naturall man knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.12.</note> in reſpect of true knowledge: for which cauſe the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch natural men (how wittie ſoeuer they be in their owne conceite) ſayth plainely, if they thinke they know any thing, (meaning <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.2.</note> in the miſteries of God, they know nothing (ſayth he) as they ought to know.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we may affirme for certaintie, without any further proofe, that no man by his owne naturall reach of wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, can iudge of the vertues and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of faith, but onely ſuch as are renewed and borne againe by the ſpirite of God.</p>
               <p>Now then (as I ſaid) is it any marueil that this precious Iewel of faith, is ſo ſmally eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13012:9"/>
&amp; ſlenderly acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted of in the world, of meere worldly &amp; carnal men? Seing they haue no skil at al to iudge of the rare vertues and operation therof, neither by meanes of the outward ſenſes of their bodies, nor yet by the force &amp; powers of their ſouls, but are altogether like vnto the Cocke, wherof the fable ſpeaketh, that ſeeing a precious Gem or Iewell lying on the donghill, wiſhed hee had had one graine of Barley for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Iewell, becauſe hee knewe not the price and vertue of the ſame, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did wiſh for that, which ſerued beſt, to the ſatisfying of his owne appetite and deſire.</p>
               <p>Seeing then the caſe thus ſtandeth, that moſt people are ſo miſerably deceiued, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with greedie earneſtnes and deſire, and as it were with both hands apprehending the vaine &amp; tranſitory things of this life, &amp; make ſmall or none accompt, but euen like filthie ſwine trample vnder their feete, <note place="margin">Gods Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of worldly men.</note> thoſe precious pearles of the worde of God, of faith and free ſaluation purchaſed by the bloud of Chriſt, to the high diſhonouring of Almightie God, to the endaungering of their owne ſoules, to the great ſcandale or offence of other, &amp; to the extreme griefe of hearte of each true faithfull and godlye Chriſtian; ſeeing the caſe thus ſtandeth (I ſay) and theſe premiſes duely conſidered, I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13012:10"/>
haue thought it meete, and verily agreeing with my calling, to ſpend a litle time in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triuing theſe plaine and ſimple treatiſes of faith, and the fruites thereof hereafter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, to this end that partly by the helpe hereof, if God giue a bleſsing thereunto, but chiefely by prayer, reading, and hearing of Gods word preached, the ignorant ſort may attaine vnto the knowledge of faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miſteries of God by grace, which wee by our owne natural knowledge and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, are not able to attaine vnto: and that alſo theſe rich gifts of God, as faith, &amp; the reſt, may be the better accompted of, to Gods glorie, and our eternall comfort and ſaluation..</p>
               <p>And becauſe it is the minde of the holy <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1, 5.</note> Ghoſt, (as Saint Peter noteth) that all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues whatſoeuer ſhold be linked vnto faith, as the verye fountaine from whence they muſt ſpring, therefore I haue made this my firſt Chapter, wherein I will (God aſsiſting me) in as briefe manner as I can, declare and make plaine to thoſe, whoſe eyes it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to open, what an excellent and precious Iewell fayth is, as alſo what great profit &amp; commodity we receiue by it.</p>
               <p>But here firſt of all, intreating of fayth in generall, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to make knowne what faith it is whereof I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate; for there is a certaine Morall fayth
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13012:10"/>
or truſt, which we call fidelitie, that ought to be betweene man and man, and euen this is a vertue worthy of commendation: ther is alſo an Hiſtoricall faith, when we onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the bare Hiſtorie, whether it bee hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or diuine, without any further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it vnto our ſelues, and this faith is alſo in ſome ſort worthy of due praiſe: and there is a Temporary faith, when ſome doe beleeue for a time (as our Sauiour ſaith) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Mat. 13.21.</note> worthie to be commended, but is like vnto that faith whereof Saint Iames ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, that is dead in it ſelfe (to ſpeake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <note place="margin">Iam. 2.17.</note> of that fayth which is called miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, becauſe it hath ceaſed for the moſt part, ſince the time of the Apoſtles).</p>
               <p>Now it is not my purpoſe to entreate of any of theſe, ſeeing they are gifts common <note place="margin">What faith it is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Saint Peter wold haue ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ioyned.</note> to the good and to the bad<hi>:</hi> neither doeth Sainte Peter meane to linke his Golden Chaine with any one of them, for that wold diſgrace his whole worke: but that fayth which I mind to ſpeake of, is ſupernaturall, diuine and heauenly, far more glorious and excellent, then can be comprehended (as I haue already ſaide) by the wit and naturall vnderſtanding of man.</p>
               <p>But what is it (wil ſome ſay) that you doe ſo commend? Wilt thou know? Surely it is that, which thy tongue hath vttered a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times, when thou haſt ſaid I beleeue in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13012:11"/>
God. And is this ſuch a great matter (will worldlings ſaye) to beleeue in God? Doth this onely thing deſerue ſo great praiſe and commendation? Yea verily. But here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, <note place="margin">A Caueat.</note> leaſt thou deceiue thy ſelfe in the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the words; for there be three things almoſt like in words, but farre differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in true ſence &amp; meaning: namely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue God, to beleeue there is a God, and to beleeue in God. The deuils beleeue the firſt and the ſecond, that God is true of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is to beleeue God, and they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo beleeue there is one God, and no more, and tremble (as Saint Iames ſaith) but they <note place="margin">Iam. 2.19.</note> beleue not the third, that is in God, which is as much as to embrace him for our good God, and to reſt &amp; repoſe our ſelues on him and his worde onely, which is that true iuſtifying faith, wherof I ſpeake. So then we muſt take heed (as I ſaid) that we do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <note place="margin">True faith beleeueth in God.</note> our ſelues, thinking we beleeue verie well, if we beleeue God, and beleeue there is a God, which thing indeede we ought alſo to do, but we muſt goe further, to beleeue in God, that is to acknowledge him for our good God &amp; Sauior, &amp; this is ment by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I beleeue in God, I beleeue (I ſay) &amp; not another for me, for euery one ſhall be ſaued by his owne faith, and not by anothers, as the Prophet Habacuk ſaith: The iuſt ſhall <note place="margin">Haba. 2.4.</note> liue, by his owne faith.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13012:15"/>
both for the preſeruation of mans ſoule, &amp; body, in this life, and for their eternal ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the life to come. Who then hearing of ſuch a precious iewel, woulde not ſell all that euer he hath to buy it?</p>
               <p>Nowe the rare vertues and operation of Faith, were not ſo commonly knowen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſauiour Chriſt came in the fleſh, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a few did account of it, as Abraham and others, both before and in the time of the <note place="margin">Faith more plainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed ſince the Goſpell then before.</note> Lawe: but now ſince the Goſpel hath been preached, faith hath been openly reuealed, now it hath beene highly commended, and extolled. What meant our Sauiour Chriſt, when he would ſhew the vertue and power of his Godhead, in working of his cheefeſt miracles and healing all kind of diſeaſes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore to ſay, thy faith hath made thee whole, thy faith hath ſaued thee? ſurely it was Chriſt himſelfe that healed them, yet <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 22. Marke 10. 52.</note> he attributeth the ſame to the faith of them that were healed, therby to ſhew the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Faith, and that except they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue &amp; had faith, they could not be healed.</p>
               <p>There be three thinges to be conſidered <note place="margin">Three things eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Goſpel, ſerue to the extolling of Faith.</note> in the Goſpell, which make very much to the extolling of Faith. The one is, that Chriſt did helpe a great many for their own faith. Another that he healed ſome of their bodily diſeaſes, for the faithes ſake of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The third is, that want of Faith in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13012:15"/>
ſome, was a great hinderance vnto Chriſt, that oftentimes he could not doe that good which otherwiſe hee woulde. Theſe three points may be ſhewed briefely by examples. for the firſt ſorte wee haue theſe examples: The foule leaper that came vnto Chriſt, in <note place="margin">Mat. 8.2.</note> the eight of Mathew, ſhewed his faith plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this, ſaying vnto him, if thou wilt thou canſt make me cleane: to whome Ieſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I will, be thou cleane<hi>:</hi> and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately his leproſie was cleanſed.</p>
               <p>Another example we haue in the ninth of Mathew, of that woman which had been diſeaſed with an iſſue of bloud twelue years, <note place="margin">&amp; 9. 22.</note> who thruſting in among the preſſe of people to touch but the hem of Chriſt his garment, was preſently healed, to whome Chriſt ſaid, thy faith hath made thee whole. And in the fourteenth of Mathewe, it is ſaid, that <note place="margin">&amp; 14.36.</note> many were healed by touching of Chriſts gar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, becauſe they beleeued that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heale them. Another example wee haue of two blind men, in the ninth of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, which cried after Ieſus to be healed, <note place="margin">&amp; 9.22.</note> but hee firſt asked them, whether they did beleeue, that hee was able to heale them, (not that Chriſt was ignorant whether they did beleeue or not, but to ſhewe vnto them, and others, that he woulde not helpe them, except they did beleeue): and they ſaide, yea Lord: then ſaide Ieſus, according
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13012:16"/>
to your faith be it vnto you: and preſently their eyes were opened. The like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wee haue of blinde Bartimeus in the tenth of Marke, which cried after Ieſus, <note place="margin">Mark. 10, 52</note> (whome hee called the ſonne of Dauid) to haue mercy on him, &amp; neuer ceaſed crying, till Ieſus called him, and opened his eyes, ſaying vnto him, thy faith hath made thee whole: Many ſuch examples there are in the Goſpell, but for breuities ſake I paſſe them ouer.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe there want no examples of them that our ſauiour hath healed for the faithes ſake of others: I will alſo produce a fewe of them. The Centurions ſeruant, in the eight of Mathew, that lay ſicke at home of a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, <note place="margin">Mat, 8, 5,</note> and was greeuouſly payned, becauſe his mayſter beleeued that Chriſt was well able to heale him, if he did but ſpeake the worde onely: was cured of his diſeaſe the ſelfe ſame houre, &amp; the faith of his maiſter greatly commended.</p>
               <p>Another example we haue in the ninth of Mathew, of a man that was ſicke of the palſie alſo, and being not able to goe, was borne of foure men, and let downe in his <note place="margin">&amp; 9.2</note> bed by coardes, through the roofe of the houſe wherein Ieſus was, and Ieſus ſeeing their faith, ſayde to the ſicke of the palſie, take vp thy bed, &amp; goe home to thine owne houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:13012:16"/>
Another example wee haue of Iairus a ruler of the ſinagogue, which came vnto <note place="margin">Mark. 5.22,</note> Chriſt (as Marke ſaith) for his daughter, when ſhe was at poynt of death: and as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew <note place="margin">Mat, 9, 18</note> ſaith, ſhe was deade before hee ſpake with Ieſus, who ſaide vnto Chriſt, come &amp; lay thy hand on her, and ſhe ſhall liue<hi>:</hi> and according to his faith, ſhee was rayſed vnto life againe.</p>
               <p>Another worthy example wee haue of the woman of Canaan, in the fifteenth of <note place="margin">&amp; 15, 21,</note> Mathew, whoſe daughter was piteouſly vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Deuill, howe ſhe came vnto Chriſt for helpe, and woulde not bee aunſwered, till ſhe had her petition graunted, and her daughter healed. Thus we haue ſeene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, of ſuch as haue beene healed for their owne faith, as alſo for the faithes ſake of others.</p>
               <p>Now let vs note the thirde thing, namely that for want of faith, our ſauiour was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindered, from doing that good which hee woulde: as it is plainely to bee ſeene <note place="margin">Mark, 6, 1, 2</note> in the ſixth of Marke: when comming into his owne country, among his owne kinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and acquaintaunce, and preaching vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them on the Saboath, as his manner was, many that hearde him were aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, <note place="margin">Chriſt lea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> accounted of in his owne cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</note> and ſaide, from whence hath he theſe things? Is not this the carpenter, Maries ſon, and brother of Iames and Ioſes, and are not
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:13012:17"/>
his ſiſters (meaning by brothers and ſiſters, his nere kinſefolke) here with vs? and they were offended in him. Then ſaid Ieſus vnto them, a prophet is not without honour, but in his owne country, among his owne kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and in his owne houſe. And he could doe no great workes there (ſaith the texte) ſaue that he laid his hand vpon a fewe ſicke <note place="margin">Vnbeleeſe hindereth vs of many good things</note> folkes, and healed them: but he marueiled at their vnbeliefe: ſo that we ſee vnbeleefe was the onely cauſe, which hindered Chriſt from doing them that good which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he would.</p>
               <p>The like or worſe thing we read of the hoggiſh Gergeſites, which by reaſon of their <note place="margin">Mat. 8.34.</note> want of faith, eſteemed more of their ſwine then of Chriſt: &amp; therefore prayed him that he wold depart from them. But what ſhould I heape vp examples of ſuch as were neuer effectually called? ſeeing it is certaine, that many of Gods children, by reaſon of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes of their faith, or for want of faith in ſome particular things, haue almoſt hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red themſelues of many good things, yea &amp; brought themſelues into great danger. The weakenes of Marthaes faith, had almoſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.39 40.</note> that her brother Lazarus ſhoulde haue beene raiſed againe, when hee had layne in in the graue foure daies, for ſhe ſaide vnto Chriſt he ſtinketh<hi>:</hi> to whome Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13012:17"/>
Said I not vnto thee, that if thou didſt beleeue thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God? as if hee ſhoulde ſay, thy weakenes of faith doth hinder this miracle.</p>
               <p>For want &amp; weakeneſſe of faith, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſt were almoſt drowned, while <note place="margin">Mat. 8.25.</note> Chriſt ſlept in the ſhip, for when they had awoke him ſaying, wee periſh, hee rebuking them ſaid, why do ye feare, O ye of little faith. And Saint Peter himſelfe when hee woulde come alone vnto Chriſt vpon the <note place="margin">&amp; 14.31</note> ſea, was not farre from drowning, and all for want of faith. For want of faith, godly Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias, the father of Iohn Baptiſt, was <note place="margin">Luk. 1.2.</note> dumbe for a time, becauſe hee did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the tidinges which the Angel brought him of the birth of his ſonne. Thus haue we briefly noted theſe three things: Firſt how many haue beene healed by their own faith: next, that not a few haue beene healed by the faith of others<hi>:</hi> laſtly, that weakenes &amp; want of faith, hath hindered Chriſt from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good, &amp; brought euen the deare childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God in daunger. Whereupon wee may conclude, that faith is a moſt rare and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar vertue, worthy of all praiſe &amp; commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
               <p>Nowe if faith were alwaies required for the health of their bodies, how much more <note place="margin">Faith good for the health of ſoule and body.</note> for the health of their ſoules? And was not this the cheefeſt purpoſe of Chriſt (thinke
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13012:18"/>
wee) to lead them by theſe outward meanes to conſider of the weakenes and ſickneſſes of their ſoules? yes ſurely: and the doctrine thereof is moſt neceſſary for vs to conſider of<hi>:</hi> For wee are all full of the foule leproſie of ſinne, from top to toe, but faith in Chriſt doth make vs cleane: for it is written, the blood of Ieſus Chriſt clenſeth vs from all <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.7.</note> ſinne. We are all benummed with the dead palſie of ſinne: But faith in Chriſt doth quicken vs againe: as Chriſt ſaith, He that beleeueth in me, though hee were dead, yet ſhall he liue. We are all blinde, and cannot <note place="margin">Ioh. 11. 25</note> ſee the way that leadeth vnto life, but faith in Chriſt muſt be our guide: We are all deaf and cannot heare as we ſhould, the word of God<hi>:</hi> till faith haue opened our inwarde ſences. In one worde, there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of the ſoule or body, which is not ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holpen, or eaſed by the benefite of faith.</p>
               <p>Is thy heart and ſoule wounded within thee, by reaſon of thy ſinne? Faith is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne and cordiall medicine: it will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heale thee. Haſt thou had a longe time ſcales vpon thine eyes, that thou canſt not ſee the brightneſſe of Gods worde ſhine vpon thee? Oh, apply the ſalue of faith mixt with the powder of true repentance, and thou ſhalt ſee howe ſoone they will
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13012:18"/>
fall from thee, as they did from the eyes <note place="margin">Act, 9, 18</note> of Saule. Art thou oppreſſed with heauie ſadnes? why, faith in Chriſt will bring thee ioy. If thou bee ſicke, it will reſtore thee to health. Art thou poore? it will make thee riche, Art thou deade? it will rayſe <note place="margin">By faith all things are poſsible. Mark. 9.23.</note> thee to life againe: all thinges are poſſible, vnto him that beleeueth.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou yet heare more what bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite thou receaueſt by faith: hearken then: By faith wee are made the ſonnes of God<hi>:</hi> By faith wee ſhall obtayne euerlaſting life<hi>:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 1, 22 &amp; 3<hi>:</hi>6 &amp; 11.25 &amp; 3.36 &amp; 6, 47</note> By faith hee that is deade may liue: Hee that beleeueth, ſhall neuer die. Hee that beleeueth hath euerlaſting life.</p>
               <p>Contrariwiſe, whatſoeuer is not of faith, <note place="margin">Rom. 14, 23 Heb, 11, 6: Ioh. 3, 36 Mark<hi>:</hi> 16, 16</note> is ſinne. Without faith, it is impoſſible to to pleaſe God: Without faith, wee ſhall bee condemned. Hee that beleeueth not, the wrath of God abideth on him: He that beleeueth and is baptiſed, ſhall bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but hee that beleeueth not, ſhalbe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>This true, liuely and iuſtifying Faith, <note place="margin">Mat, 22, 12:</note> whereof wee ſpeake, is that riche wedding garment, which euery chriſtian ought to weare: and whoſoeuer is founde without it ſhall bee bounde hande and foote, and caſt into vtter darkeneſſe, there ſhall bee weepinge and gnaſhing of teeth.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13012:19"/>
This faith is that ſtrong ſhielde of defence, <note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.16.</note> wherwith we muſt quench all the fiery darts of the Deuill: if we want this armour, wee ſhal ſurely be ſlaine of Sathan. This faith is the light of the body, which who ſo hath <note place="margin">Mat<hi>:</hi> 6.22.</note> not, walketh ſtill in darkenes not knowing whither he goeth. This faith is vſually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto a hand, wherwith we receiue (as one ſaith) the rich almes of God: if we lack this hand, wee ſhal die for want. This holy <note place="margin">Faith the mother of repentance.</note> faith is called the mother of true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and repentance the daughter of faith, for aſſoone as wee haue a true iuſtifying Faith, preſently repentaunce followeth with the fruites thereof, as Saint Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt ſaith, Bring fourth fruit worthy of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

Paul mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth by ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, that faith is chiefer then loue,</note> extend it ſelfe farre and neare to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and profit of our neighbours, (for faith profiteth our ſelues, &amp; loue our neighbours) and, becauſe it doth continue longer then faith and hope doth, for the vſe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both doth ceaſe, when wee haue the fruition and poſſeſsion of that which wee hoped for, and when we haue the end of our faith, which is the ſaluation of our ſoules<hi>:</hi> but loue is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begun in this life, &amp; perfected in the life to come: in theſe reſpects Saint Paul ſaith, it <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1, 9.</note>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:13012:20"/>
is cheefe. Notwithſtanding, though wee graunt this, and ſay further with the ſame Apoſtle, that as there is no true loue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, ſo there is no true faith, without loue, becauſe faith worketh by loue: yet it <note place="margin">Gala. 5.6.</note> is certaine, that faith in reſpect of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in this matter of iuſtification, is more excellent then loue: yea, loue muſt come after faith, as an obedient daughter <note place="margin">Loue the daughter of faith.</note> after her mother; which faith doeth bring forth both hope and loue. Faith then is the ground of things hoped for. Hope is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted expectation of thoſe things, which are promiſed vnto vs of God by the meanes of Chriſt. Loue is linked vnto them both, &amp; may not be ſeperated from them.</p>
               <p>By faith, ſaith the Author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brus, our forefathers obtained a good report: <note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.2</note> therefore I conclude, that faith ought ſtill to haue the preheminence in iuſtification: for thereby are we receiued &amp; made the ſonnes <note place="margin">Faith muſt haue the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of God, euen by our faith in Chriſt, by whome wee obtaine euerlaſting life. This doctrine, as it doth ſtirre vs vp to beleeue, ſo ſhould it ſtir vs vnto loue &amp; charitie, which are the liuely fruites of faith, and without it faith is dead in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>But here wee muſt alſo take heede, that we doe not imagine, that faith (though it be a rare and ſingular vertue) doth thereby of it ſelfe deſerue euerlaſting life, for ſo wee
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13012:21"/>
ſhould fal into error, but faith is called moſt <note place="margin">Chriſt only hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for vs. faith the inſtrument to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it.</note> holy, excellent or precious, in this reſpect, that it is the meane appointed by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, wherby we ſhould apprehend and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue moſt holy, excellent &amp; precious gifts, whereof the chiefeſt is eternall and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, purchaſed vnto vs, by the death, paſsion, and reſurrection of Chriſt, euen by his righteouſnes, and obedience. Of this eternal and euerlaſting life, our faith groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon the promiſes of God doth moſt certenly aſſure vs; and then by hope (which is alſo the childe of faith) we doe with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence waite for the accompliſhment, and performance thereof. For thoſe ioyes, which one day we ſhall haue in perfect poſſeſsion, <note place="margin">How faith and hope are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.</note> wee doe now enioye by faith, and hope: the which may thus bee diſtinguiſhed, the one from the other: Faith doth apprehend things preſent; and hope things to come: by things preſent, I meane alſo eternall life; which may be ſaid to be preſent, in reſpect that we haue ſome feeling and taſt of it in this life, &amp; in reſpect of the certainty of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and will, touching the ſaluation of his elect, that cannot be altered. Therefore the Scripture vſeth often times the preſent tenſe, for the future, the time preſent, for the time to come, as Chriſt ſaith, Hee that beleeueth, hath euerlaſting life. And Saint Paul ſaith, by grace ye are ſaued. <note place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

By things to come, I meane the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and performance of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which in this life we doe patiently waite for, and expect by hope; therefore hope is ſometimes vſed in the ſame ſence that faith is, as in the eight to the Romaines, Saint Paul ſaith we are ſaued by hope, that is by <note place="margin">Rom. 8.24</note> hope, our faith is ſupported, and wee are comforted, til we haue the end of our faith, euen the ſaluation of our ſoules.</p>
               <p>Againe, this difference is betweene faith, and hope, that faith doth imbrace and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <note place="margin">Wherein faith and hope agree.</note> the promiſes of things, and hope the things whereof the promiſes are made, onely in this, faith and hope agree, that they haue alwaies reſpect vnto one and the ſelfe ſame benefits. As for example, when Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <note place="margin">Gen. 17.19.</note> was promiſed to haue a ſonne in his olde age, he did verily beleeue it, but with hope did expect the performance thereof many yeares. He was promiſed alſo the land of Canaan, to him and his ſeede<hi>:</hi> he did ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily <note place="margin">Gen. 17.8.</note> beleeue it ſhould be accompliſhed, but yet hee did onely enioy the ſame by hope. Thus we haue ſeene briefely the difference betweene faith, hope, and loue, as alſo how they agree in one: but of loue we ſhalſpeake more (God willing) in the laſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>Now let vs proceede a little further in our purpoſe, to ſhew the excellencie and worthines of faith, whereby we are aſſured

               <p>Through faith we are aſſured of our elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before the foundations of the world were laide: God hath choſen vs (ſaith Saint Paul) in Chriſt before the foundation of the <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1.4.</note> world, that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in loue.</p>
               <p>Through faith wee are aſſured of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God: for God was in Chriſt, (ſaith the Apoſtle) and reconciled <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5.19</note> the world vnto himſelfe, not imputing their ſinnes vnto them.</p>
               <p>Through faith wee are aſſured of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, iuſtification and ſanctification: Ye are of him (ſaith Saint Paul) in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <note place="margin">1, Cor. 1.30</note> who is made vnto vs wiſedome, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, ſanctification and redemption.

In reſpect of Sathan, our faith fighteth for <note place="margin">Ephe. 6.16.</note> vs againſt his temptations, and in reſpect of the world, wee doe by little and little ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it.

               <p>By faith, the poore woman of Canaan, ſaide vnto Chriſt, that it was lawfull for <note place="margin">Mat. 15.28.</note> dogges to eate vp the crummes which fall from their Maſters table: whoſe fayth alſo Chriſt highly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended, ſaying vnto her, Woman, great is thy faith, bee it vnto thee euen as thou wilt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:13012:27"/>
But what ſtand I to reckon vp more exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to this purpoſe, let vs looke vp into the ſtarres of heauen, and if we be able to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, then may wee alſo bring into a <note place="margin">The ſtarres of heauen, and the faithfull children of Abraham innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> reckoning all the true ſonnes of Abraham, regiſtred in the booke of Gods reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, for their ſtrong and ſtedfaſt faith in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of God, made vnto Adam, Abraham, and the reſt of Gods elect, ſince the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the worlde. Theſe examples which I haue noted, and manye other which of purpoſe I omit, are ſurelye written for our learning, that wee through patience <note place="margin">Rom. 15.4.</note> and comforte of the Scripture might haue hope.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the great and glorious titles wherby the faithfull are called in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <note place="margin">How the faithful are named in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> make not a little to the commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this faith, whereof wee ſpeake. The faithfull are called the ſonnes of God, the ſonnes of light, liuing ſtones, the temple of the holye Ghoſt, the bodye of Chriſt, the houſholde of God; the fellow Cittizens of <note place="margin">2.

Wherfore, ſeeing we haue heard ſo great commendation of faith and faithfull people, what maruaile is it, that the Scripture euerye where doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte vs vnto faith, and that Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all his Apoſtles did take ſo great
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13012:27"/>
paines, to bring the world vnto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith, by the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and reioce in nothing more, then to heare &amp; ſee how that the Churches of God, where the Goſpell hath beene preached, did continue in their faith?</p>
               <p>Therefore Saint Paule in the firſt to the Romanes did thanke God, that their faith <note place="margin">Rom. 18.</note> was publiſhed throughout the world. And <note place="margin">Coloſſ. 1.2</note> in the firſt to the Colloſſians hee beginneth thus: To the ſaintes and faithfull brethren in Chriſt: and by and by he ſaith: We giue thankes to God, ſince we heard of your faith <note place="margin">3.</note> in Chriſt Ieſus: And againe in the ſeconde Chapter hee ſaith: I reioyce to behold your <note place="margin">Chap. 2. 5.</note> order, and ſtedfaſt faith in Chriſt: And in the firſt to the Theſſalonians and firſt he ſaith, <note place="margin">1 Theſſ<hi>:</hi> 1.2</note> We giue God thankes for you, without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, remembring your effectuall faith. And in the ſecond to Timothie &amp; firſt, he calleth <note place="margin">3</note> to remembrance the vnfayned faith, which <note place="margin">2 Tim<hi>:</hi> 1.5.</note> dwelt firſt in his grandmother Lois, and in his mother Eunice. And to Philemon hee writeth thus: I giue thanks when I heare of <note place="margin">Phile. 1.4 5.</note> thy loue, and faith. What doth all this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto vs, but that this ſaith whereof wee ſpeake, is moſt excellent in the ſight of God and man?</p>
               <p>Hence commeth it to paſſe, that the ſame Apoſtle doth ſo earneſtly exhort vs vnto this <note place="margin">1 Cor, 16 13.</note> faith, &amp; to abide in it. Stand faſt in the faith,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13012:28"/>
(ſaith he) quite you like men, and be ſtrong. Againe, hee ſaith, Proue your ſelues whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2.13.5</note> ye are in the faith. Againe, We walk by faith, and not by ſight. Againe, Aboue all, <note place="margin">Epheſ, 6, 16 1 Tim. 1, 5 &amp; 6.11, 12</note> take the ſhielde of faith, wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, The ende of the commandement, is loue, out of a pure harte, and of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp; of faith vnfained. And vnto Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy he ſaith, But thou O man of God, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after righteouſnes, godlineſſe, faith, loue, patience, meekenes, and ſo forth: <note place="margin">Faith muſt fight for vs. 2. Tim. 1.13</note> By and by hee ſaith, Fight the good fight of faith.</p>
               <p>Againe, keepe the true patterne of the wholeſome wordes which thou haſt hearde of mee, in faith and loue in Chriſt Ieſus. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee bids vs to doe good vnto all, but eſpecially to them that are of the houſholde <note place="margin">Tit. 2, 2</note> of faith. And to Titus he ſaith, let the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men be ſound in the faith. And in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle <note place="margin">Heb, 4, 2. Gods word profiteth not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith. &amp; 11.6.</note> to the Hebrewes, it is ſaide, that Gods worde profiteth vs not, except it bee mixt with faith. And without faith it it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God. For a concluſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, Bee faithfull vnto the death, &amp; I wil giue thee the crown of life. What tounge then can expreſſe the <note place="margin">Reuel. 2.10</note> excellencie of faith, and the profite wee receiue by it! Contrariwiſe, all woe and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13012:28"/>
miſerie is theirs that haue not this faith: for <note place="margin">All woe is theirs that haue not faith. Rom. 14.23</note> without faith, whatſoeuer wee doe is ſinne: whether we pray, reade, ſing, eate, drinke, labour: or whatſoeuer wee doe without this faith, I ſay it is ſinne. Iannes &amp; Iambres are compared with the reprobates that want <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.8, 2 Tim. 1.20</note> faith. Hymeneus and Alexander are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with eternall infamie, becauſe they made ſhipwracke of their faith.</p>
               <p>For want of faith, the man in the Goſpel that preſumed to come to the wedding, was bounde hande and foote and caſt into vtter <note place="margin">Mat. 22.12 13.</note> darkenes, there ſhall be weeping &amp; gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth. Finally, as vnbeleefe was the cauſe that ſo many thouſands died in the wilderneſſe, and ſo fewe entred into the lande of Canaan: ſo vnbeleefe, and want of <note place="margin">Vnbeleefe the cauſe that ſo fewe entred into the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed land. Heb. 3.19</note> faith, is the cauſe that ſo many ſhal die eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in the worlde to come, and bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned vnto the bottomles pit of hell. For this is the laſt concluſion (almoſt) of the whole Bible, ſpoken by him that ſhal iudge both quick and dead. The feareful &amp; vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing, (ſaith he) that is, all ſuch as haue not this true iuſtifying faith, whereof we haue all this while intreated, ſhall bee caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Reuelat. 21.8.</note> the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>For the auoyding of which endleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13012:29"/>
let vs betime bewaile our own block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhnes, that hitherto haue ſo little eſteemed of this ſo precious a Iewell of Faith: let vs learne to make more account of Gods word, then heretofore wee haue done: let vs pray the Lorde to forgiue vs that is paſt, and to increaſe this holy faith in vs, for time to come: ſo ſhall wee bee bleſſed here &amp; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. And ſo much concerning the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of faith, and the vtility or profit we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by it.</p>
               <p>Nowe it ſhal be neceſſary for vs, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, before we conclude this Chapter, from whome this faith commeth, that is, whoſe gift it is, and to whom it is giuen: to this end, that none may imagine faith to be a naturall gifte, common to all<hi>:</hi> ſeeing it is giuen one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, whoſe names are written in the booke of life.</p>
               <p>Firſt that faith is the gifte of God, I think <note place="margin">Faith the gift of God.</note> none will denie, and therefore I ſhall not neede to ſtande long about the proofe thereof. When Saint Paul ſaith, we are ſaued by grace, through faith: preſently he ſaith Not of our ſelues, it is the gift of God. <note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.8</note> Sainte Iames ſaith, euery good giuing, &amp; <note place="margin">Iam. 1, 17</note> euerie perfect gifte, is from aboue, and commeth downe from the father of light: that is, from God, which is called the light that none can attaine vnto: but faith is a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13012:29"/>
good and perfecte gifte<hi>:</hi> therefore ſurely it commeth from God.</p>
               <p>Againe, Saint Paule writing vnto the Philippians, ſaith: Vnto you it is giuen <note place="margin">Phillip. 1.29</note> through Chriſt to beleeue<hi>:</hi> therefore to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue is the gift of God. Againe in the twelft to the Hebrewes, the holy Ghoſt exhorteth vs to runne with patience, the race that is ſet <note place="margin">Heb. 12.1.2</note> before vs, looking vnto Ieſus the authour &amp; finiſher of our faith: Therefore faith muſt needes bee the gift of God.</p>
               <p>Moreouer when the Apoſtles of Chriſt doe pray the Lorde to increaſe their fayth, <note place="margin">Luk. 17. 5</note> they doe thereby plainly ſhew, that faith is the gifte of God. Againe, Paule planteth, Apollos watereth, by preaching of Gods <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.6</note> worde; but God giueth the increaſe, that is, faith to beleeue. Many ſuch places there are, but theſe may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Nexte nowe, that this excellent gifte of faith is not common to all, appeareth by this one ſaying of Saint Paule vnto the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians<hi>:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3, 2</note> All men haue not faith. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">To whom faith is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; in what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> it is a thing moſt neceſſarie to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, to whom this faith is giuen, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee giuen to all in a like meaſure or not.</p>
               <p>Here, firſt of all wee are to conſider of the giftes of God, howe ſome are temporall, ſome eternall, ſome common with the good
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:13012:30"/>
and bad, ſome giuen onely to Gods electe. The giftes that are temporall, are all things that pertaine to the vſe of this preſent life: yea and life it ſelfe is a temporall gifte, becauſe it is decreed that wee muſt all die. The benefite of the aire, the benefite of the earth, the benefite of the water, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of the Sunne and firmament, and all the creatures in eyther of them, are temporall giftes, ſeruing onely for the vſe of man in this life, and common to the good, and to the bad: as Chriſt ſaith, that God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſeth the Sunne to ſhine vpon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and the good, and the raine to fall vpon <note place="margin">Mat. 5, 45</note> the iuſt and vniuſt.</p>
               <p>Againe, the giftes of the minde, as wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, reaſon, knowledge, memory, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the like, are all temporal giftes, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with the giftes of healing, of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying, <note place="margin">Temporall gifts</note> and working of miracles, as Chriſt ſaith in the ſeuenth of Mathewe: Many will ſay vnto mee at the day of iudgement, Lorde, Lorde, haue wee not by thy name propheſyed, and by thy name caſt out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, <note place="margin">Mat, 7, 22</note> &amp; by thy name wrought many great miracles? and then I will profeſſe to them, ſaith Chriſt, I neuer knew you, depart from mee all ye that worke iniquitie. <note place="margin">23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, other accidentall giftes (as we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13012:30"/>
ſay) of the body, as health, ſtrength, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, riches, honors, and the like, are all ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and temporall giftes<hi>:</hi> and no man can certenly iudge thereby, whether the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 1. No man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certenly iudge by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, or not hauing of temporal bleſſings whether he be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, Spirituall gifts.</note> thereof bee eyther beloued or hated of God. And that is the meaning of Salomon when hee ſaith: No man can know whether hee bee in the loue, or hatred of God: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by the hauing, or not hauing of theſe earthly and temporall giftes.</p>
               <p>Nowe, on the other ſide, the giftes that are heauenly, are faith, loue, ioy, peace, meekenes, temperance, patience, godlines, Iuſtification, ſanctification, adoption, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and finally, eternal and euerlaſting ſaluation<hi>:</hi> all theſe giftes are giuen onely to ſuch as God hath elected to bee heyres of ſaluation, according as Sainte Paule ſaith: <note place="margin">Rom. 8, 29</note> Thoſe which God knewe before, hee alſo predeſtinated, to be made like to the image of his Sonne: thoſe whome hee predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, them alſo hee called. Whome he called, them alſo he iuſtified<hi>:</hi> and whome <note place="margin">30</note> hee iuſtified, them alſo hee gloryfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>So then it is certayne, that Faith and all theſe other heauenly giftes, are gyuen onely to the choſen and elect peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Tit. 1, 1:</note> of God: for which cauſe, faith is called
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:13012:31"/>
by Saint Paule, the faith of Gods electe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine it is ſaid in the Actes of the Apoſtles, that ſo many as were ordained to eternall life, beleeued and ſo were ſaued. Againe, all <note place="margin">Act. 13. 48. Eph. 2.8.</note> that are ſaued, are ſaued by grace, through faith: therefore ſo many as are ſaued, haue faith, and none other. No man commeth vnto me (ſaith Chriſt) but thoſe the father <note place="margin">Iohn 6, 44. Mat, 13. 11. Faith is a miſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> draweth. And to his diſciples hee ſaith, To you it is giuen to knowe the miſteries of the kingdome of heauen, but to others it is not<hi>:</hi> Againe, faith is a chiefe part of the miſterie whereof Saint Paul ſpeaketh: Therefore to ſome it is giuen to haue faith, &amp; to ſome it <note place="margin">1, Tim. 3.16</note> is not: Againe, Chriſt ſaith in the tenth of Iohn: Ye beleeue not, why? becauſe ye are <note place="margin">Iohn 10, 26</note> not of my ſheepe: that is, none of thoſe who are elected vnto ſaluation: therefore none but Gods elect do beleeue.</p>
               <p>Here further we learne, that faith is not giuen vs in reſpect of any righteouſnes, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite <note place="margin">Faith is not giuen for our owne worthines:</note> or deſert, that is in vs: but of God his free mercy, as well to the Iewes, as to the gentils: to the Grecian, and to the Barbarian: to the bond, and to the free<hi>:</hi> to male, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, whereſouer throughout the whole world, diſperſed, as many as be elected vnto ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Now, although man knoweth not the time <note place="margin">No time ſet when wee ſhalbe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</note> when, yet certaine it is that euery one of the elect ſhalbe called, one time or other, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:13012:31"/>
as God in his diuine prouidence hath appointed. For as he chooſeth whom he wil, ſo thoſe whome hee hath choſen hee calleth vnto faith by the miniſterie of his word, and effectual working of his holy ſpirit, when it pleaſeth him: vnleſſe by his ſecret worke, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his euerlaſting counſel and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee call them in their infancie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of this world, before they come to yeeres of diſcretion. Heereuppon it is that he calleth ſome in their youth, ſome in their middle age, and ſome not before olde age: ſome at the dauning of the daie, ſome at the <note place="margin">Math. 20. 3 4, 5, 6</note> third houre, ſome at the ſixt houre, &amp; ſome at the eleuenth houre: ſo long as the time of this preſent life indureth, and this light of grace continueth, ſo long the time laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the heauenly calling.</p>
               <p>Let no man or woman therfore deſpaire, <note place="margin">Let none deſpaire of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, for he that is not called to day may be to morow.</note> or doubt of their ſaluation, that are not yet effectually called, for they knowe not howe ſoone they may be, only let euerie one praie that when God doth call, we may bee ready to yeelde our obedience: eſpecially let not the preachers and miniſters of Gods word be diſcouraged, though in a long time they ſee little fruit or their labors: for faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times which is planted by their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Faith ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times co<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uered as fire in the aſhes,</note> doeth lie cloſe hidde and couered, as the fire in the aſhes: one daie, when God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:13012:32"/>
will, it ſhall breake out into flames of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye and godlynes: at leaſt wiſe, if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell which we preach bee hidde, it is hid to <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4. 3</note> them that periſh: as many as are ordained vnto ſaluation, ſhall at one time or other yeeld their obedience, and ſo eternally bee ſaued.</p>
               <p>But becauſe it falleth out often <note place="margin">A comfort for weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</note> times, that manye of the deare children of GOD, are verye much grieued, yea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt plunged in the pitte of deſperation, when they heare that none but ſuch as haue faith ſhall bee ſaued, becauſe they themſelues doo not feele the heate of faith, ſo effectuallie as they deſire: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue thought it verye neceſſarye, before I conclude, brieflie to ſhewe, that there are diuerſe meaſures of faith, ſome <note place="margin">He that hath the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of true faith ſhalbe faued.</note> greater, and ſome leſſer, and that the leaſt meaſure of faith, if it bee true fayth, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth vnto ſaluation: ſo ſhall none of Gods children (I hope) bee diſcouraged, when ſathan ſhall caſt into their mindes, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlenes of their faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt, euerie chriſtian muſt holde for certaine that which Saint Paul teacheth in the fourth to the Epheſians, namely, that there is one Lord, and one fayth: next, <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 6</note> it is behoofefull for vs to knowe, that this one faith is giuen to the faithful in diuers &amp;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:13012:32"/>
ſundrye meaſures, according as Saint Paule ſaith in the twelfth to the Romanes, That <note place="margin">Rom. 12.3</note> euerie one muſt vnderſtande according to ſobrietie, according as God hath dealt to euerie man, the meaſure of faith, to ſome a greater meaſure is giuen, to ſome a leſſer.</p>
               <p>Alſo the fruites of faith are not in all <note place="margin">The fruites of faith are not alike in all the faith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>full.</note> the faithfull a like: as namely, one fayth, full man and woman hath and may haue more knowledge, more loue, more feare of God, more hope, more patience, more brotherlie kindenes, and ſo foorth, then another hath, according as hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a greater meaſure of faith: but yet the meaſure of faith, by the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of God, is ſo diſtributed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that there are none of Gods elect, to whome is giuen leſſe then may ſuffice vnto ſaluation, for the meaſure of faith doth contayne this in it ſelfe, that there is a ſufficient portion to euerie one: hee that hath the leſſer meaſure, ſhall haue ſaluation, with him that hath the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe it is done by the ſpeciall counſell and prouidence of God, that one hath a greater meaſure of fayth then another; for God hath ſo moderated all thoſe thinges, by his wiſedome, that to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13012:33"/>
thoſe whom hee hath appointed to endure many great battels, hee hath giuen a larger portion of faith. As to Ahraham, Iſaack, <note place="margin">To thoſe whom God wil try moſt hee giueth moſt faith.</note> Iacob, Moſes, Dauid, and the like, whom when hee would try by many trybulations and temptations, he vouchſafed to beſtow vppon them a greater meaſure of faith, not that therby they ſhould attaine vnto ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather then other that haue leſſer gifts of faith, but that they ſhould ſerue to the furthering of Gods glory, and that they might bee examples to thoſe, that are more infirme and weaker.</p>
               <p>Now, if any would knowe what the leaſt meaſure of faith is that any man or woman can haue: ſurely it is this, when a man of an <note place="margin">What the leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of faith is.</note> humble ſpirit, by reaſon of the litlenes of his faith, doth not yet feele the aſſurance of the forgiuenes of his ſinnes, and yet is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they are pardonable, and with his heart prayeth God that hee would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and forgiue them. Now that ſuch a one hath faith, it is perceiued by the good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires <note place="margin">Eſa. 57.17</note> and prayers which he maketh, becauſe ſuch prayers and deſires, are teſtimonies of the ſpirit of God, whoſe property is, to ſtirre vp a longing and a luſting after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly <note place="margin">Good prai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers a token of true faith. Rom. 8.26</note> thinges, with ſighes and groanes for Gods fauour and mercy in Ieſus Chriſt: and where the ſpirite of Chriſte is, there
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13012:33"/>
is Chriſt dwelling, and where Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">2. Cor 13.5</note> there is true faith, howe weake ſo euer it be.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, faith though it bee but lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is the gifte and working of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by this ſaying of the Apoſtle Saint Paule, that it is God that worketh both <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13</note> the will and the deede: therefore, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath this good will and deſire in him, it is certaine that there is the preſence and working of Gods holie ſpirite. Nowe wee muſt not iudge of the grace of God by the abſolute perfection or quantitie of faith, but onely by the foundation whereuppon it reſteth, which foundation is the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, the obedience, ſatisfaction, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of the ſonne of God imputed vnto vs, for faith is, (as before is noted) the <note place="margin">A Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> hande wherewith wee apprehende and laie ſure holde vppon the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus. And euen as a lyttle childe maye as truelye holde a golde ring or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious iewell wyth his litle and weake hand, as a giant with all the force of his hande and fiſt, beeing one and the ſelfe ſame ring, ſo the merits of the ſonne of God, bee one and the ſame, whether our faith bee weake, or ſtrong to apprehend them.</p>
               <p>This then beeing (as wee haue ſayde) the leaſt meaſure of faith, when wee haue an earneſt deſire to bee ſaued, and yet haue not the full aſſurance of our ſaluation: it
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13012:34"/>
is then our dutie daily to praie the Lord to increaſe our faith, till we come by little and little vnto the greateſt meaſure, which wee ſhall not haue at the firſt, but in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time, when wee haue bene well practiſed in repentance (for as ſoone as wee haue the leaſt meaſure of faith, repentance will alſo appeare in ſome meaſure.) When therfore (I ſaie) we haue ſome time bin well practiſed in repentance, and haue had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe experiences of Gods loue towards vs in Chriſt, then afterwardes will appeare in our hearts the fulneſſe of perſwaſion, which is the ripeneſſe and ſtrength of faith. For this is the greateſt meaſure of faith, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie one daylye increaſing in faith, comes to be fully perſwaded of Gods loue in Chriſt, <note place="margin">The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt meaſure of faith.</note> towards himſelfe particularly, &amp; of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of his owne ſins.</p>
               <p>This I ſuppoſe is the greateſt meaſure of faith, how be it, I am ſtill perſwaded, that there is no mans faith ſo ſtrong; but it is <note place="margin">No mans faith ſo ſtrong, but it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

luſt. So that now wee ſee, what muſt bee the chiefe and principall care of all thoſe, that haue receiued this excellent gift of faith, wherof we haue ſpoken in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Namely, to giue all diligence to ioyne vnto our faith vertue, that ſo our faith may appeare by our honeſt liuing, &amp; godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation. Wherefore in this chapter wee muſt ſpeake of vertue in generall, being the ſecond lincke in Saint Peters Chaine, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward come to her particular branches.</p>
               <p>Vertue in generall is obedience to Gods commaundements, wrought in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">what vertue is, &amp; from whome we haue it.</note> by the ſpirit of ſanctification, directed or referred to the glorie of God, and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of him in Chriſt Ieſus. And to ſpeake plainly, whatſoeuer thing is good &amp; honeſt, that is vertue. Vertue (ſaith one) is a ſtrong caſtle, that can neuer be wonne, a riuer that ne edeth no rowing, a ſea, that moueth not<hi>:</hi> a fire that quencheth not: a treſure, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hath an end: an army, neuer ouercome: a ſigne that neuer deceiueth: a plaine waie that neuer faileth: a ſirupe that forthwith healeth, &amp; a renowme that neuer periſheth. Againe, vertue in all workes is chiefly to be praiſed, as the head fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain &amp; chief iewel of all maner of riches. Vertue aboue all things <note place="margin">Vertue offe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>reth her ſelf to all that will receiue her.</note> doth (or ſhuld) purchaſe to men good wil, friendſhip, &amp; loue. Vertue, ſaith another, is ſhut vp from no man, that is willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine her: ſhee receiueth all men glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe calleth all ſorts (and ſexes) of men &amp;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13012:37"/>
women, kings, Queenes, ſeruants and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed men, ſhe requireth neither houſe nor ſubſtance, but is onely contented with the naked man.</p>
               <p>Againe, vertue exceedeth all earthly things, for, if liberty, friends, health, wealth, &amp; proſperitie fall from thee, yet vertue will keepe thee company<hi>:</hi> therfore vertue in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſity is beſt tried. Trauell therefore, ſayth one, and take paines to ſpend thy life in the trade of vertue: the pain is but ſhort, but thy vertue ſhall euer indure. The waie of vertue is hard at the beginning, but the path being once troden, it ſhall ſeeme verie pleaſant. The leſſe time that a man hath to liue, the more earneſtlie is the ſtudie of vertue to be imbraced. That perſon is not worthie to liue, that will not ſtudie to liue vertuouſlie. Vertue is praiſed of many but there are few that effectuallie follow it. Men will put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to pains for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> attaining of anie thing ſaue vertue and honeſtie. It is a great vertue to flie thoſe things our ſelues, which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue in others<hi>:</hi> he that liueth vertuouſly in this life, his ſoule ſhall haue reſt with God. Theſe are the ſayinges indeede of heathen men, which onely had the light of nature to guide them, whervnto now if we adde but this, that this vertue whereof they ſpeake muſt bee ioyned vnto faith, then doubtleſſe <note place="margin">Vertue muſt be ioy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned vnto faith.</note> their ſayings are godly and ſound, and moſt worthy to bee imbraced of vs chriſtians.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13012:37"/>
Otherwiſe without faith vertue will vaniſhe <note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> away as a ſmoake. And as it is not poſsible, to fill that veſſell with wine, that is already full with puddle water, except wee firſt em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye the veſſell, no more is it poſsible, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one can haue true vertue abounding in him, that hath not his hart firſt purged from vice and ſinne by faith.</p>
               <p>This was the cauſe that heathen men which wanted faith in Chriſt, were not able to attaine vnto true vertue; onely they ſawe the ſhadow thereof in the glimmering light of nature, the ſubſtance wherof was farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue them. They were like vnto children, which ſeeing the moon ſhining in a pool of <note place="margin">Another ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</note> water, ſeem to ſnatch after it to take her in their hands, but aſſone as they trouble the water, their endeuours are fruſtrated: euen ſo thoſe heathen men ſeemed ſtil to ſee ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſhining from heauen, but aſſone as they troubled the waters of their vnderſtanding, to reach after it, preſently they were decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of their purpoſes. Whoſoeuer therefore will attaine vnto the ſchoole of vertue, muſt haue faith, &amp; the knowledge of Gods word to lead him thervnto.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, we muſt takeheed that we <note place="margin">Gods word ioined with faith, wyll bring vs to the ſchoole of vertue.</note> mixe not vice and vertue together (for they can indeed no more agree then fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) but my meaning is, that we do not hide and couer ouer our vices, with the cloake of vertue, or rather hipocriſie; for like as the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13012:38"/>
eie cannot looke vpward and downeward <note place="margin">Similitudes</note> both at one time, no more can the mind of man, applie vice and vertue together. And as in a paire of tables, nothing may be well written, before the blots and blurs be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out, ſo Vertue cannot abide with anie, except he firſt put away his vices; according to the ſaying of a godlie father, We cannot attaine vnto the kingdome of Vertue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we firſt ſhake of the yoke of vices. This is the onely cauſe therfore, why ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire vertue, &amp; ſo few attaine vnto it, becauſe few men will forgo for vertue ſake, that vice and ſin which he beſt loueth.</p>
               <p>Many perhaps, will leaue for a time ſome <note place="margin">The reaſon why we do deſire ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but yet not attaine vnto it.</note> certein vices; becauſe they would ſeeme to bee vertuous, but when vertue commeth to be their gueſt, one foule ſin or other beats her backe againe. One will leaue ſwearing, drunkennes, and ſuch like<hi>:</hi> another will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake theft or ſtealing with the hande<hi>:</hi> an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lying and falſwitnes bearing; but yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one of theſe will be either an idolater, adulterer, or vſurer; and ſo ſtill retaine one ſin or other to chaſe vertue from them. Thus leauing of ſome ſinnes, ſhall be a cloak vnto them, to couer other more fouler vices, to the end they maye ſeeme vnto the world vertuous and religi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ous. But euen as iron &amp; <note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> clay cannot be tempered together, no more can vice &amp; vertue agree together in any one man: therfore it is wel ſaid of one, Either be

Wherfore it is moſt neceſſary for al chriſtians to know, that true vertue which proceedeth from faith, is a moſt holy thing: &amp; therefore as Moſes muſt put of his ſhoos before he might talke with God; ſo muſt we caſt from vs vice and ſinne (I meane the delight and continuance in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſſe ſin, be it neuer ſo pleaſant or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vnto our fleſhly nature) before this heauenly gift of vertue, wil harbour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine within vs. When Elias ſhould aſcend <note place="margin">2. King. 2 13.14</note> vp into heauen, he muſt firſt caſt downe his mantle<hi>:</hi> ſo doubtles no man ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be partaker of this true vertue, before hee caſt the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of vice &amp; ſin away from him, ſpecially the cloak of hipocriſie, which is moſt worne of any garment in this land. How ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue <note place="margin">Many chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges of appa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rell, onelye hypocriſye neuer chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged.</note> we ſeene new faſhions, and changes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell in this Countrie? yet this garment doth remaine ſtill vnaltered. They that are aſhamed to weare one ſute of apparell two daies together, are not aſhamed to weare this old cloake of hipocriſie many yeeres.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:13012:39"/>
Surely among all other ſinnes hypocriſie <note place="margin">Hypocriſye the chiefeſt enemie to vertue.</note> is the moſt deadlyeſt enemy vnto vertue. In vertue there may bee nothing counterfait, for therein is the onely image of verity. Therfore it is well ſayde of S. Cyprian, that it profiteth not to ſhew vertue in wordes &amp; to deſtroy it in deedes. Vertue then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt is a iewell of great worth, for euen the wicked doo deſire to haue it: at leaſtwiſe couet to make ſhew to the world that they haue it; becauſe they would bee the better accounted of. For like as a precious ſtone in a gold ring, ſo ſhineth an heart that is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Vertue beſt tried in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſytie.</note> in vertue. They therfore that will make ſhewe to the world, that they haue vertue, when it is not ſo, are like vnto them that gilde gold vppon copper rings, that their brauery may appeere for a little while, but in a ſhorte time it weareth away. Golde is tried by the touch, and vertue by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it: if it be counterfait, in time of aduerſity it will appeare. That is true vertue in deede, which hath bin tryed in the fire of tribulation, as the gold in the furnace.</p>
               <p>Nothing can eaſily corrupt a mind who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dedicated to vertue. As wormes will not eate the wood of cedar; ſo nothing can hurt the ſoule poſſeſſed with vertue: true vertue ioyned with faith, doeth adorne the ſoule of man, and cauſeth it to aſpire vnto hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thinges. Therefore doth Saint Peter ſay, Ioyne vertue with your faith. And Saint
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13012:39"/>
Paule ſaith, Whatſoeuer thinges are true, <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 8.</note> whatſoeuer thinges are honeſt, what ſoeuer things are iuſt, whatſoeuer thinges are pure, whatſoeuer thinges appertayne vnto loue, whatſoeuer things appertaine vnto good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: if there be any vertue, if there bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayſe, thinke on theſe thinges, and then the God of peace ſhall bee with you.</p>
               <p>But here wee may note by the way, that this vertue in generall hath included in it, many more particular branches, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle Saint Peter hath linked together in his chaine; which to intreat of at large, would be very tedious: therefore let this one word of S. Paule ſuffice for all, whatſoeuer thing is of good report, let that bee imbraced for a vertue: onely I think it meet, to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing here of humilitie, becauſe (as S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">humility the keeper of vertue.</note> ſaith) ſhe is the keeper of vertue.</p>
               <p>And God himſelf, the giuer of faith, &amp; al other vertues, hath moſt reſpect vnto them that in humblenes of minde, caſt themſelues downe before the preſence of his maieſtie. For thus ſaith he that is high and excellent, he that inhabiteth the eternity, whoſe name <note place="margin">Eſay 57. 15.</note> is the holy one: I dwell in the high and holy places: with him alſo, that is of a hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and contrite ſpirite, to reuiue the ſpirite of the humble, and to giue life to them that are of a contrite hart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:13012:40"/>
But what is humilitie? ſurely by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it is thus defined, To be a vertue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee doe acknowledge our owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <note place="margin">A definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</note> &amp; vncleanes, ioyned with the true feare of God, whereby alſo we do keep our ſelues within the bounds and limits of our calling, truſting in the diuine helpe, not deſpiſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inſtruments, and meanes appointed of God: but acknowledge the giftes of God in others, as well as in our ſelues, knowing that our indeuours cannot proſper, without the bleſſing and helpe of God. Moreouer, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, is to yeeld obedience vnto God, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting vs for our faultes, and not to fret and fume againſt his maieſty. Which thing, S. Peter meaneth when he ſaith, Humble your ſelues vnder the mightie hand of God: and <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5<hi>:</hi>6,</note> he ſhal exalt you in due time. Humilitie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many other vertues, is highly comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>What got Lucifer and the other Angels by pride? when they were not content with their firſt eſtate in heauen? were they not <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 4.

               <p>Now, ſhal wee thinke, that God woulde ſo ſeuerely puniſh pride in heauen, and yet ſuffer proud men vnpuniſhed here on earth. Surely no, they ſhall not goe altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed in this world, though their eternal puniſhmente bee alſo reſerued till the <note place="margin">Eſter 7.10.</note> iudgement of that great day.

The like, or farre greater puniſhment one day, ſhall befall that proude beaſte of Rome, with ſeuen heades, and ten hornes<hi>:</hi> euen that Antychriſt and child of perdition, <note place="margin">Reuel. 17.7</note> whom the Lord ſhall conſume with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of his mouth, and ſhall aboliſh with the brightneſſe of his comming: becauſe in the great pride of his heart, he exalteth himſelf <note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2, 3 4.

Wherefore, ſeeing pride and arrogancy of hearte, is ſo odious before God, let vs the rather imbrace true humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, ſo ſhall wee be beloued of God and men<hi>:</hi> as one ſaith, Humbleneſſe and lowlineſſe of mind, maketh a man highly in fauour with God: &amp; meekenes of wordes maketh him to ſinke into the harts of men.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13012:41"/>
of heart is the glorie of youth and age, and giueth vnto them both dignitie and honour. That may rightly be called genterie, that is begun, continued, and ended in true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. according to our engliſh prouerbe, A gentleman, hath gentle conditions. It is the ſaying of a ſage man, that the higher a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one is in authority, ſo much the more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and lowly ſhould he behaue himſelfe: and that nothing is more ſeemly, or commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a prince or noble man, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vertue of gentleneſſe, meekenes, and humilitie. For the gentle and lowly minded man cannot lightly be hated: Vertue, ſpecially learning <note place="margin">Humility maketh a man belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> with humility hath aduanced many men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great honor &amp; dignitie: agreeable to that ſaying of Salomon, Before honour goeth hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie: and againe, The reward of humility, is life, riches and glory. Man is in nothing <note place="margin">Prou. 15.33 &amp; 22, 4.</note> more like vnto God, then in gentleneſſe &amp; humilitie. The vertue of humilitie ſaith one, encourageth to attayne truely the Law of God, and maketh apte veſſels to receiue the ſpirit of God: according to this ſaying of Dauid, Them that be meek wil God guide <note place="margin">Pſal. 25.9.</note> in iudgemente, and teach the humble his way.</p>
               <p>Therefore the prophet Dauid, knowing the great vertue of humilitie, maketh this proteſtation of himſelf in one of his Pſalms: <note place="margin">Pſal. 131.</note> Lorde ſaith hee: I am not highe minded,

I haue no proude lookes: but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, my ſoule (ſaith hee) is euen as a wayned childe, meaning that hee was humble in heart as a child.</p>
               <p>And ſurely, the example of a childe is <note place="margin">We muſt learne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of children<hi>:</hi>
                  </note> very forcible to teach vs humilitie<hi>:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt himſelfe vſed the ſame example vnto his Apoſtles, when in pride of hart they demanded who ſhoulde bee greateſt in the kindome of heauen. Then Ieſus called a little childe, and ſet him in the middeſt of his diſciples, and ſaide vnto them: Verely I <note place="margin">Mat. 18.1.2</note> ſay vnto you, except ye bee conuerted and become as little children, ye ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdome of heauen: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, Whoſoeuer ſhall humble himſelfe as this little childe, the ſame is the greateſt in the kingdome of heauen.

Galat. 5.22.</note>
               </p>
               <p>True humilitie and gentleneſſe of minde, is a cheefe fruit of the ſpirite of God. The fruite of the ſpirte (ſaith Saint Paul, is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gentlenes, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo forth: Therefore is it that the ſame Apoſtle doth ſo earneſtly exhort vs <note place="margin">Colloſ,. 3 12 13.</note> vnto humilitie, As the elect of God (ſayth hee) holy and beloued, put on tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:13012:42"/>
long ſuffering. Thus wee ſee, how hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie is both commanded &amp; commended vnto vs. Now let vs a little conſider, howe that as God in his iuſtice, hath euermore throwne downe the proude, ſo in his mercy hee hath exalted the humble and <note place="margin">Examples how God hath exalted the humble Numb. 12.3</note> meeke.</p>
               <p>Moyſes that man of God, among all his vertues, is commended for nothing more, then for his humilitie and meekenes<hi>:</hi> for he is ſaide to bee the meekeſt man vpon earth: and ſee how hee was exalted of God, When his father and mother had left him, by the <note place="margin">Exod. 2.3.4 5.</note> riuers brinke among the bulruſhes, God cauſed him to bee taken vp, aduanced him to the court of Pharao, and after made him a prince and a gouernour ouer his owne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Little Dauid the ſonne of Iſhai, becauſe hee was little in his owne eyes, and as wee haue heard before, humble in heart as a wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Pſal. 78, 70, 71</note> childe, therefore God did exalte him &amp; tooke him from following the Ewes great with yong, and aduanced him to the kingly throne. Neyther haue we onely examples of men, but alſo of women, as of Eſther, that of a poore captiue, hauing nor father, nor <note place="margin">Eſter 2, 17.</note> mother aliue (onely a good kinſeman Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay) was by God aduanced to be the wife of a King.</p>
               <p>What inould we ſpeak of the humilitie &amp; low eſtate of the virgine Mary, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13012:43"/>
was choſen by God himſelfe to bee the mother of Chriſt. This great working of God in throwing downe the proude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the lowly, doth that holy Virgine well note in her ſong of reioycing, when ſhe ſaith, My ſoule doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirite reioyceth in God my ſauiour: by <note place="margin">Luk. 1.46.</note> and by ſhe ſheweth the reaſon, For he hath looked on the poore degree of his ſeruant, &amp; ſcattered the imaginations of the proude<hi>:</hi> He hath put downe the mightie from their ſeates, and exalted them of lowe degree. The verie ſame thing doth Hanna the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Samuel, note in her prayer, ſaying, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.7 8.</note> The Lord maketh poore, and maketh riche, bringeth lowe, and exalteth: hee rayſeth the poore out of the duſt, &amp; lifteth vp the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the dunghill, to ſet them among Princes, and to make them inherite the ſeat of glorie.</p>
               <p>Hence is it that Saint Paule faith (though <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1, 27 28.</note> to another purpoſe) that God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world, to confound the wiſe: and God hath choſen the weake things of this world, to confound the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie things: &amp; vile things, &amp; things which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen: &amp; things that are not, to bring to nought things that are: that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is written, hee that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. <note place="margin">Ierem, 9.24</note>

Thus we haue ſeene how God doth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more exalt them that are humble and lowly in their owne eyes. Let vs therefore make much of humilitie. But yet, to proceede a little further, if we wil haue examples of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, then let vs come to the example of <note place="margin">The chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</note> all examples, euen to the example of Chriſt Ieſus the Sonne of God. Which example Saint Paule doth propoſe vnto vs in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the Philippians, ſaying. Let the ſame <note place="margin">Philip. 2.5.</note> mind bee in you which was in Chriſt Ieſus, who being in the forme of God, thought it no robberie to be equall with God, but hee made himſelfe of no reputation, and tooke on him the forme of a ſeruant, &amp; was made like vnto men, and was found in his ſhape as a man, he humbled himſelfe, and became o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient vnto the death, euen the death of the Croſſe, wherefore God hath highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted him: and ſo forth.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt not only learne, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Chriſt to be humble and lowly in <note place="margin">We muſt learne by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt to be humble both in proſperitie, and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie. 1. Pet. 2.21 22.23.</note> proſperitie, but alſo in aduerſitie, when we ſhall ſuffer any thing for his ſake: for here in ſaith Saint Peter, hath Chriſt left vs an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that we ſhould follow his ſteps, who when hee was reuiled, reuiled not againe, when hee ſuffered hee threatned not, but in great humility, committed his cauſe to God that iudgeth righteouſly. Therefore Chriſt for his great meekeneſſe and humilitie, is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:13012:44"/>
compared in the Scripture vnto a Lambe, <note place="margin">Chriſt for his humility compared to a ſheepe and to a lambe. Ioh. 1.36. Eſay. 53.7. Chriſtians called the ſheepe of Chriſt.

And Eſay by the ſpirite of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſaide, that Chriſt was oppreſſed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted: that hee was brought as a ſheepe to the ſlaughter, yet opened he not his mouth. This great humilitie of Chriſt ought to bee followed of all Chriſtians, who are therfore called the ſheepe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Vnto this humilitie Chriſt himſelfe doth exhorte vs ſaying, Learne of me, that am meeke and lowly of heart, and ye ſhall finde reſt vnto your ſoules, Learne of Chriſt: what <note place="margin">Mat. 11.29</note> ſhall we learne?

Our ſoules, which are the chiefeſt parts of man, are defiled and pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſinne, and filthines; whereof then ſhould man be proud? <hi>O eſca vermium</hi> (ſaith that ſweete father) <hi>O maſſa pulueris, &amp;c.</hi> O Wormes meate, O froath, O vanitie, why art thou ſo proud and inſolent?

               <p>And is not the ſame thing to be noted in the creation of man, who is called by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, a little world? Yes truely, for the life of man without light is moſt tedious and vncomfortable. Now looke what the <note place="margin">Knowledge vnto the ſoule, is as light vnto the eyes of the body.</note> light of the eyes is vnto the body, the ſame is knowledge vnto the ſoule; for a man that hath neuer an eye to ſee with all, if he haue knowledge in his minde, is much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, then hee that hath two eyes without knowledge. They that want the benefite of their eyes and ſight, are called blinde, and they that want the benefit of knowledge, are called ignorant: the one is blindneſſe of the body, the other of the ſoule. As therefore it

is impoſsible for a blind man of himſelfe to goe into a farre Countrie or Cittie, where <note place="margin">We cannot attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vertue, without knowledge</note> he was neuer before<hi>:</hi> ſo it is impoſsible for him that hath no knowledge, euer to attaine vnto the kingdome of vertue.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe is it, that Saint Peter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting vs vnto vertue, doth bid vs to take <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.5.</note> knowledge for our guide, ſaying, Ioyne with your vertue knowledge: as if he ſhould ſay, It is in vaine for you to labour for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of vertue, except you bee firſt indued with the light of knowledge. Knowledge then is the keye which openeth the gate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſchole of vertue. Knowledge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is a vertue or power of the ſoule, which <note place="margin">What knowledge is.</note> is occupied in the finding out of things, and the cauſes of things, whether they bee good or euill. Of knowledge, ſome is naturall, ſome artificiall, and ſome ſupernaturall, but each of them the gift of God.

               <p>Now this knowledge which wee haue by nature, is very much holpen by Art &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13012:47"/>
&amp; this I call artificiall knowledge, <note place="margin">Nature ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much holpen by arte.</note> when by the benefit of learning wee attaine vnto an higher degree of knowledge then the vnlearned doe. This kind of knowledge and learning, whoſoeuer doth not account of, is not worthie to be reckoned among the number of men. Notwithſtanding, this is not ſimply that knowledge which Sainte Peter meaneth, when hee ſaith, ioyne with your vertue knowledge, But that which I ſaid is ſupernaturall, euen in one worde, the knowledge of God in his Sonne Chriſt: which knowledge Saint Peter wiſheth vnto vs, when he ſaith, Grace and peace be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by the knowledge of God, and of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus <note place="margin">2.

               <p>But yet before I entreate at large of this knowledge, I thinke it meete to ſpeake ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what <note place="margin">Learning a good meanes to bring vs to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</note> more of that knowledge: which wee haue by the benefit of learning, becauſe it is a notable meanes to bring vs vnto the true knowledge of God.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was a fine ſaying of Bias the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, (when hee ſaw ſome in daunger of looſing their goods) <hi>Omnia mea mecum porto.</hi> I carrie (ſaith hee) all my goods with mee, meaning, his learning which is indeede the ſafeſt riches. Therefore one ſaith, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a begger, then vnlearned.</p>
               <p>And indeede, how many haue wee ſeene and reade of, that of poore mens children haue beene by learning &amp; knowledge high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduanced? As on the contrarie, many for want of learning that haue had greate ſtore of wealth and ſubſtance left them, by their friends, yet haue come to great pouertie in the end. Learning therefore muſt needes be an excellent thing: it maketh the poore men to become rich, and it teacheth rich men wel to diſpoſe their goods, leaſt they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pouertie. The more high and honourable <note place="margin">The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter calling, the more neede of learning.</note> any one is in calling, the more neede a great deale hath hee of knowledge and learning. They are in a wrong opinion, ſaith one, that ſuppoſe learning to be nothing auailable to the gouerment of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth.

               <p>If we haue had and now haue, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hereof in this land, let vs giue God <note place="margin">Neuer any nation felt a ſweeter commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned prince, then Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> the praiſe, and pray for the continuance of it: let Scholes &amp; ſchollers, be accompted of, for they are the ornament of Church and common-weale. Let Schollers apply their minds to all good learning, and knowledge in their youth, for they knowe not to what preferment it may bring them before they be old: Learne ſuch things, ſaith Plato, when thou art a childe, as may profit thee, when <note place="margin">It is better to take paines in youth then to be vnler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in olde age.</note> thou art a man; endeuour thy ſelfe to learne in thy youth, though it be painefull, for it is leſſe paine for one to learne in his youth, then in age to be vnlearned.</p>
               <p>There be two things much to bee lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our time, the one, that a great deale of time is miſpent before wee attaine vnto learning, the other, becauſe when wee haue attained thereunto, we make little vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note place="margin">Three things to be lamented in our age.</note> to profite Church or common-weale; as though wee muſt bee learned onely for our ſelues. An other euil there is as bad or worſe then the former, if any by their induſtrious labour, ſeeke to doe good to manye, they that neuer meane to doe good to any, will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13012:49"/>
be the firſt that ſhall ſpeake euill of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuours. Therefore one ſaith well, to lacke knowledge, is an euill thing: to diſdaine learning is worſe, but to ſpeake euill of them that ſeeke to profit other, is worſt of all, and fartheſt from all grace. If any haue miſpent time as too many doe, when they be young, let them bee the more ſtudious in their age, remembring that ſaying of Socrates, It is no ſhame for a man to learne that he knoweth not, of what age ſoeuer he be.</p>
               <p>Now as learning and knowledge is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended, ſo on the contrarie, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note place="margin">No ſhame to learne goodnes be we neuer ſo olde.</note> is much to be diſpraiſed. They which be ignorant (ſaith Plato) and of euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, bee verie vnhappie, for where igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſinne is, there infidelitie and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie moſt plainely appeareth.

The ignoraunce and want of knowledge, that is in brute beaſtes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth plainly the difference that is betweene man and them, for ſo much differeth man from the dull and brutiſh beaſt, as he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe by knowledge, to bee clearely vnſpotted of ignoraunce: Ignoraunce is the <note place="margin">Ignoraunce can neuer ſpeake well of learning.</note> defamer of learning and knowledge.

euill of the things they know not. Idleneſſe ingendereth ignoraunce, and ignoraunce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth error; if therefore wee will auoide the errors of this life, let vs applie our ſelues vnto learning and knowledge.</p>
               <p>Thus much I haue thought good to ſpeake of learning and knowledge in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall (which I call artificiall knowledge) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as it is before ſaid) it is a good meanes (being not abuſed) to come vnto the true knowledge of God, whereof now wee muſt intreate, Howbeit, becauſe GOD ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (in this pointe) worketh by meanes, and ſometimes without meanes, let vs take <note place="margin">Two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treemes to auoided.</note> heede of theſe two extremities, that we doe neuer deſpiſe theſe externall helpes of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, becauſe ſome haue had the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of GOD without them, neither deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire of obtaining the true knowledge of God, becauſe wee are not learned in other artes and ſciences. For true it is, that Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes was learned in all the wiſedome of the Egyptians, and they were no hinderances, but rather furtherances vnto him, to ſerue <note place="margin">Acts. 7.22. Humane ſciences a helpe to Moyſes in his calling So likewiſe to Paule &amp; Apollos.</note> GOD in his calling, after he had reuealed his word and knowledge vnto him. Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the knowledge of tongues, and other liberall ſciences were great helpes vnto Paule and Apollos in the worke of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, therefore where God giueth theſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13012:50"/>
gifts, let them be accounted of, and vſed to his glorie.</p>
               <p>But yet let none thinke, the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God to bee tyed to theſe outward <note place="margin">Gods grace, not tied to outward meanes.</note> meanes, for Chriſt doth giue thanks to God his father, becauſe he reuealed the ſecreſies of his Goſpel to babes and ſucklings; that is, to ſuch as had no more knowledge in liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">Mat. 11.25</note> ſciences, then babes and ſucklings haue. And S. Paul ſaith, where is the wiſe? Where is the Scribe? Where is the diſputer of this world? Hath not God made the wiſedome <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.20</note> of this world, fooliſhnes? Meaning, that no man be he neuer ſo learned and wiſe, could by his owne natural reach of wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, attaine vnto the true knowledge of God and of Chriſt<hi>:</hi> againe, this ſaying of the Apoſtle muſt ſtand, The naturall man cannot perceiue the things that are of God. Wherefore when Saint Peter biddeth vs to <note place="margin">1.

Let the word of Chriſt dwel in vs plenteouſly in all wiſedome, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and admoniſhing one another, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one hath obtayned more knowledge one then another, that yee may bee blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe (ſaith the Apoſtle) and pure, and the ſonnes of God without rebuke, in the mids of a naughtie and croked nation, <note place="margin">Phil. 2.15.</note> among whome ſee that ye ſhine as lightes in the world.</p>

               <p>In vaine (ſaith one) is that long tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell in ſtudie and learning where actuall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth not ſhew forth her fruites, for learning &amp; knowledge is of good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſought for, and lodged euen in their breaſtes to this only end, that they may therby know ſinne,

               <p>Therefore Saint Peter ſaith. Ioyne with <note place="margin">2. Pet 1. 5. Knowledge teacheth the way to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> your vertue knowledge, that is, let know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge teach you the way to vertue, and by vertue and godlynes of life, let it appeare that you haue knowledge. Let knowledge &amp; vertue bee ioined together, for they may not be ſeparated: as a generall or captaine, is the directour of an whole hoſt, ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lightened with true knowledge is the <note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> guide of mans life. But here we are to note, that euen in this knowledge whereof wee ſpeake, there is a meane to be kept, for the prouerbe is, <hi>Omne nimium vertitur in vitium,</hi> euery too much is an euil, and S.

We muſt therefore keepe our knowledge within compaſſe, and neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire more then is meete for vs to knowe. Saint Paule, though hee were excellent in knowledge, yet he eſteemed not to know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye thing ſaue Ieſus Chriſt, and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Heereof might ariſe this ſaying, <hi>Si Chriſtum diſcis, ſatis eſt, ſi caetera neſcis, Si Chriſtum neſcis, nihil eſt ſi caetera diſcis.</hi> If <note place="margin">To knowe Chriſt is the chiefeſt knowledge.</note> thou knowe Chriſt, it skilleth not though thou bee ignoraunt in manye other thinges: contrarywiſe, if thou knowe not

Chriſt, all other knowledge in the world is to no purpoſe. This caueat and admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I thinke not to be vnneceſſarie in theſe dayes of ours, when as manie wanton wittes haue wandered abroad in the fields of their owne inuentions, to ſeeke and ſearch out for hidden and ſecrete thinges, ſuch as God hath not reuealed vnto vs in his worde: yea, they will not ſticke to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what God did before the world was created, forgetting in the meane while, what their duties do require of themſelues heere on earth, nothing fearing that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Salomon, Hee that ſearcheth out the ſecretes of Gods maieſtye, ſhall bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed <note place="margin">Wee muſt not enquire out of Gods ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies more then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed in his word</note> with his glorye. They remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not that Adam in ſeeking (by taſting the forbiden fruite, to knowe more then God would haue him to knowe, was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of that excellent knowledge hee had before.

Thus haue wee ſeene what an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent thing learning and the true knowledge of God is, and how we ought to applie the ſtudie thereof, to this end, that wee might

verie extreamlie ſicke, and almoſt at point of death with ſinne, and neuer care to ſeeke for health, nay, wee will ſcarce receiue Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke for our ſoules, though it bee brought home vnto vs freely without money, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out penny or penny worth. Euen as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Eſaie complaineth of the Iewes that refuſed to receiue the grace of God, which <note place="margin">Eſay. 55.1.2.</note> was offered vnto them freely without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, but were willing to laie out their ſiluer for that which was nought worth, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they could not be ſatisfied. What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell then is it, that the ſinfull ſoule of man is ſo diſtempered and out of order, inſomuch that the beating of her pulſes, may bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with out feeling?

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13012:58"/>
faith, knowledge, and the reſt.</p>
               <p>But what is temperance? Temperance or ſobrietie (ſayeth one) is a vertue which doth moderate the appetites and deſires of meate, drinke, and other thinges, which <note place="margin">What tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is.</note> man maye lawefullie vſe: ſo that neither prayer, meditation, ſtudying, or labouring in our vocation, bee hindered with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe thereof, neyther our naturall ſleepe nor health of our bodyes hurted for want of that which is ſufficient<hi>:</hi> ſo it ſeemeth that temperance is a keeper of a meane in euerie thing. And euen as in tunes or <note place="margin">A ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> ſinging, without the meane there can bee no good melodye, ſo in the gouernment of our life, without ſobrietie or tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, euerie thing will bee diſordered. Where Temperance ruleth not, there is gluttonie, ſurfetting, drunkennes, luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, and all kind of wickednes. Where Temperance beareth ſwaye, there the health of the bodie is preſerued, there alſo the ſoule of man is at libertie, to reade, to praye, to ſtudie, to meditate, to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, <note place="margin">Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance a worthy ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</note> to giue counſell, to gouerne all the affayers of this life. Where temperance is, there is ſhamefaſtnes, there is honeſty, there is chaſtitie, there is modeſtie, there is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, there is moderation and good order kept, in diſcerning what ought to bee done, howe it ought to bee done, and what ought to be left vndone.</p>
               <p>By temperance wee auoyde many ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:13012:59"/>
of the body, and many diſeaſes of the ſoule. Who then would not bee in loue with temperance? Temperance, ſaith one, is a noble Vertue, and chiefely appertaineth to the honorable ſtate of mankind: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the princely gouernour reaſon (which raigneth as king in man, is known to beare ſway in man, wherby all his things are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered and ordered, and thereby differeth from brute beaſtes.</p>
               <p>Temperance is an enimy to luſte, and luſt is a wayting ſeruant vnto bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Temperance calleth a man backe ſrom all wicked luſtes, and carnall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and ſuffereth him not to exceede in fooliſhe reioycing, nor in vngodlie ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing.</p>
               <p>He is to be called a temperate and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate perſon (ſaith one) which not onelie <note place="margin">Who is a temperate man.</note> doth keepe vnder his wanton and corrupt affects, but ſo endeuoreth alſo himfelfe, that in his country he is chargeable to no man, to no man cruell or grieuous, neither to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie man dangerous. Temperance therefore is a moderatrixe which cauſeth vs to keepe 2 decorum in euerie thing. Vntemperate youth, full of carnall affections, quickelie turneth the bodye into age, to bee full of infirmityes, foule and feeble. When the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled carcaſſe or foule fleſhe of man, is not well tempred, or diſcreetly ruled, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch cheriſhed, ſet at liberty, and pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, then is the ſoule the leſſe regarded
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:13012:59"/>
or looked vpon, but abideth in moſt defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Where the body is too much pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, there the ſoule is the leſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded. A ſimilie.</note> ſtate and miſerable<hi>:</hi> and the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licatly the body is handled, the more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornely it wreſtleth againſt the minde, and doth caſt it of, euen as a horſe too well che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, vſeth to caſt off his rider. If we could therefore conſider the excellency of mans nature, and the dignity thereof, wee ſhould wel perceiue how foule &amp; diſhoneſt a thing it is, to be reſolued into letcherie, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate eating and drinking, and to liue looſly and wantonly: and on the contrary, howe honeſt, fayre, and commendable a thing it is, to liue continently, temperatly, ſadly and ſoberly.</p>
               <p>But if we could ſtep a degree farther, and conſider now, not what excellency man is of by nature, but whereunto wee are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by grace, then doubtleſſe wee ſhould be aſhamed of thoſe foule vices which wee daylie commit, and giue our ſelues more to temperance, ſobrietie, chaſtity, &amp; the like, which are the true ornaments of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Vnto this temperance and ſobrietie, the ſcripture doth verie earneſtly exhort vs, and diſwade vs from the vices contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. The grace of God (ſaith Saint Paule) <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 11 Sobrietie a chiefe orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of chriſtianity. Rom. 13.11</note> hath appeared to this end, to teach vs to denie all vngodlines and worldly luſtes, and to liue ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world. Therefore he ſaith in another place: The night is paſt, the day is at hand, let vs therfore caſt away the works
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13012:60"/>
of darknes, and let vs put on the armour of light, ſo that wee walke honeſtly as in the day, not in gluttony and drunkennes, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in chambering &amp; wantonnes, neither in ſtrife &amp; enuying, but put yee on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and make no prouiſion to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the luſts of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>Againe, among the manyfold fruits of the ſpirite, which the Apoſtle Saint Paule <note place="margin">Gal: 5: 23:</note> reckoneth vp, hee nameth temperance for one. The fruites of the ſpirit are, ioy, peace, meeknes, temperance, againſt ſuch there is no lawe. And when Saint Peter would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horte vs vnto holynes, hee firſt of all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth vs vnto temperance, and ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſaying, Bee ſober and truſt perfectly in <note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.13.</note> the grace of God, and ſo foorth. And then preſentlie addeth, Bee yee holy, as God is holy.</p>
               <p>Againe, putting vs in minde of the day of iudgment, and that we ſhould take heed of Sathan, hee ſaith, Be ye ſober and watch, and, Bee ye ſober and watchfull vnto pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. <note place="margin">&amp; 4.7. &amp; 5.8.</note> Meaning, that there can bee neither prayer nor watchfulnes, without ſobriety and temperance. And indeede who findeth not by experience, that when the fleſhe is pampered vp, then drowſie ſleepines and <note place="margin">Inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perancy an enimy to ſtudy &amp; all good exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyſes.</note> ſluggiſhnes commeth vppon vs, and make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs vnapt to ſtudie, prayer, or anie good exerciſe.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe hath it beene the manner of the church of God in all ages,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13012:60"/>
whenſoeuer they woulde giue themſelues to holy exercyſes, preſently to commaund a godly and religious faſt, not from fleſh onely (as the papiſts do) but from all kinde <note place="margin">Godly faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good helpe vnto praier.</note> of meates; to the end they maye the more deuoutly ſerue God. So likewiſe doth our Sauiour Chriſte commend vnto vs abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſobrietie, and temperance, when hee <note place="margin">Mat. 26.41.</note> commaundeth vs to watch and praye, leaſt wee fall into temptation: And aboue all thinges to take heed, that our heartes bee not ouercome with ſurfetting, and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, <note place="margin">Luk. 21, 34.</note> and cares of this life, and ſo ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the day of iudgement to come vppon vs vnawares.</p>
               <p>Oh that the beaſtly belly Gods, and drowſie drunckardes of our dayes, which <note place="margin">Eſay. 28.1.</note> ſitte quaffing from morning till night, woulde ſometimes call to theyr remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance this admonition and forewarning of our Sauiour! who telleth them plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the daye of iudgement ſhall come vppon them as a ſnare, if they continue <note place="margin">Luk: 21.35</note> in their beaſtlines. But what reckoning make they of the daye of iudgement? Are not they the very mockers and ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers <note place="margin">Belly Gods and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerds make a mocke of the day of iudgment. 2.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13012:61"/>
not conſidering, that one daie is with the Lord as a thouſand yeeres, and a thouſand yeares as one daye: that it is as eaſie for the Lord to deſtroy the world with fire, as it was to make the ſame of nothing, and to deſtroy it again with water: that the Lord is not ſlacke concerning his promiſe (as ſome men count ſlacknes) but is patient toward vs, and would haue no man to periſhe, but wold all men come to the knowledge of his truth.

O conſider this all yee that forget God, leaſt hee teare you in peeces, and there be <note place="margin">Pſal: 50.22.</note> none to helpe<hi>:</hi> for ſurelye (as Saint Peter ſaith) the daye of the Lord will come (how ſone the Lord knoweth, and farre of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">2.

Seeing therefore that all theſe thinges muſt bee diſſolued, what manner perſons ought we to be in holy conuerſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and godlynes? Wherefore let vs take heed of ſurfeting, drunkennes, &amp; the cares of this life (al which now a daies are ſcarcely <note place="margin">Surfetting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes ſcarce cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

&amp; temperance, for if we would keepe our ſelues, our ſoules and bodyes in tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, chaſtitie, and ſobrietie, ſurely neither the daye of iudgment, nor the daye of our own death ſhould euer ouertake vs ſodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.

This Iohn was hee whome Ieſus loued, <note place="margin">Ioh. 21.7.</note> and yet behold hee muſt ſuffer baniſhment, perſecution, and tribulation, for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of Ieſus, though not vnto the death.

where hee came, that bonds and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould abide for him. Whereof he &amp; the reſt of Chriſts Apoſtles, and Diſciples did often times reioyce, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for his ſake.</p>

True it is, that the Church &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in this land, haue had a good <note place="margin">Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue had a good breathing time in this land.</note> breathing time, (bleſſed be God for it, and God in his great mercye continue it) theſe many yeares: but muſt we therefore thinke, that we ſhall neuer bee called to the battell, becauſe we haue beene ſpared a few yeares? Others in other Countries of Gods deare Saints and children, haue beene afflicted &amp; perſecuted: when their courſe is ended, we alſo may bee brought foorth, for there ſhall neuer be an ende of perſecution in this life, til the day of iudgement, when the bloud of all the Saints which haue beene ſlaine ſince the beginning of the world ſhal be auenged: as it is plainly to be ſeene in the ſixth of the Reuelation, for there Iohn ſayth: when the <note place="margin">Reue. 6.9.10.11.</note> Angell had opened the fith ſeale, hee ſawe vnder the altar the ſoules of them that were ſlaine, for the word of God, &amp; for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13012:69"/>
that they maintained. And they cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a loud voice ſaying, How long Lord, holy, and true, doeſt thou not iudge and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge our bloud on them that dwell on the earth? And it was ſaid vnto them, that they ſhoulde reſt for a little ſeaſon, vntill their fellow ſeruantes, and their brethren that ſhould be killed euen as they, were fulfilled.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is certein, that theſe ſoules ſhall <note place="margin">Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted one where or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the day of iudgement.</note> reſt and remaine in their place till the day of iudgement, therefore vntill that day there ſhall be ſome or other that ſhal ſuffer for the word of God, and for the teſtimonie of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.

Rather let euerie one praie dayly and howerly, when it ſhall pleaſe the Lord to lay his trials vpon vs, that he wil giue vs patience to beare them: which thing doubtleſſe he will doe, for he is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <note place="margin">A ſingular comfort that God will lay no more vpon his children then they ſhal be able to beare.

And this promiſe hath the Lord alwaies fulfilled to his Saints &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full children, in all ages. Whereof wee haue innumerable examples in the Scripture, and the Acts and Monumentes of the Church, howſome were ſtoned, hewen a ſunder, ſlaine
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13012:69"/>
with the ſword, drawen in peeces of wilde <note place="margin">Looke for examples in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Acts and Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts how God hath ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned his children in moſt gne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> horſes, roſted vpon gredirons, ſome caſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wilde beaſtes to be deuoured, ſome their skins fleyed off their ſhoulders, innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble burned vnto Aſhes in flaming fire, or conſumed by ſome other torment deuiſed by cruel and bloudy tyrants.

Pet. 2.9.</note> knoweth how to deliuer them that are his, out of temptation. Wherfore euery Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought to take boldneſſe in all afflictions: euen as Saint Paule did when he was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (for a time) out of the mouth of that Lyon at Rome: The Lord aſsiſted me (ſaith he) and ſtrengthned me, and I was deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the mouth of the Lyon, meaning from cruell Nero, Emperour of Rome, that bloudy tyrane. Whereof alſo he taketh fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.16 17.18.</note> aſſuraunce for time to come, ſaying in the ſame place, and the Lord wil deliuer me; <note place="margin">The faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that God will either deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them, orgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtrength &amp; patience to endure. Acts. 20.25. How Gods children are marty red, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, out of the hand of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. Mat. 10.28. Rom, 15.4.</note> &amp; will preſerue me vnto his heauenly king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: here then is that aſſuraunce which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one ought to haue in God, Paule was
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13012:70"/>
ſure he ſhould be deliuered, he was ſure hee ſhould be preſerued; yet no doubt hee did know that he muſt bee martyred one time or other, (as not long after he was) how was he then deliuered? His body and ſoule were preſerued vnto Gods euerlaſting kingdome. Therefore our Sauiour Chriſt biddeth vs not to feare death nor tyrants, for they can kill but the body, but rather to feare God, that can caſt both body and ſoule into hell fire. Altheſe things are written for our lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that we through patience and comfort of the Scripture might haue hope.</p>
               <p>Let theſe examples euer bee before our eyes, let vs ſerue God truely in our callings, let our truſt be wholly in him, then ſhall we neuer want patience in afflictions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reioyce in tribulations, which ſhall <note place="margin">Rom. 5.3.</note> bring forth patience. Let vs ſtill remember this ſaying of Saint Peter, it is better, if the will of God be ſo, that we ſuffer for well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.20.</note> then for euill, for hereunto are wee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as Chriſt ſuffered for vs, leauing vs an example that wee ſhould follow his ſteps: Let vs oftentimes call to remembraunce, that ſweete ſaying of our Sauiour, Bleſſed are they which ſuffer perſecution for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe <note place="margin">Mat. 5.10.11.</note> ſake, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen: Bleſſed are ye when men reuile you, and ſay all manner of euill ſayings againſt
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13012:70"/>
you falſely for my ſake, reioyce and be glad for great is your reward in heauen. Let vs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer forget theſe moſt comfortable ſayings of Saint Paule. That all the afflictions of this life are not worthie of the glorie that wee ſhall haue in the life to come. That we need <note place="margin">Rom, 8.18 31.</note> not feare the force of anye tyrants, for if GOD bee with vs who can be againſt vse who ſpared not his owne Son, but gaue him for vs all to death, how ſhall hee not withhim giue vs al things alſo? Who ſhal lay <note place="margin">No tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor perſecution canſeparate the faithfull from God.</note> anything to the charge of Gods choſen? It is GOD that iuſtifieth, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne? It is Chriſt which is dead, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is ryſen againe, who is alſo at the right hand of GOD, and maketh interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for vs. Who ſhall ſeparate vs therefore from the loue of God? Shall tribulation, or anguiſh, or perſecution, or famine, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, or ſworde? At it is written, for thy ſake are we killed all the day long, wee are counted as ſheepe for the ſlaughter, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe in all theſe thinges, wee are more then conquerours, through him that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, let vs bee aſſuredly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as Sainte Paule was, that neyther <note place="margin">Verſ. 38.</note> death, nor lyfe, nor Angels, nor princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,

This aſſurance of faith wee ought to haue in our God, in all our tryals, temptations, and afflictions whatſoeuer.

Thou bringeſt man vnto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by and by thou ſayeſt, come againe O yee children of men; thy wrath laſteth but the twinckling of an eye, but in thy preſence there is life for euermore, heauineſſe may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for a night, but ioye commeth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it pleaſed the holy Ghoſt to indite and ſet foorth in a booke the patience of Iob, for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vnto all poſteritie, hee put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this in the front and beginning thereof, that Iob was a iuſt and vpright man, one that <note place="margin">Iob. 1.1.</note> feared God and eſchewed euill. Now wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſerueth this great commendation of Iobs godlineſſe? But to this end that wee ſhoulde know, that this holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iob, did not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, by any vertue or power of his owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, beare with ſo great patience theſe great calamities and afflictions; but becauſe he was an vpright man in all his dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the world, and full of Religion and pietie towardes God: For this cauſe, as it ſeemeth was hee the patienteſt man in the <note place="margin">Godlineſſe the cauſe of patience.</note> world, becauſe hee was the holieſt and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt man that then liued in all the world: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen God himſelfe, who ſeeth the hearts of all men bearing witneſſe, for ſo God ſayth vnto Sathan, haſt thou not conſidered my <note place="margin">Verſ, 8.</note> ſeruant Iob, how none is like him in all the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13012:73"/>
earth, an vpright and iuſt man, one that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God and eſcheweth euil? So that we ſee by how much more God would try his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by ſo much the more he commendeth his godlineſſe. Iob therefore was patient, <note place="margin">Without godlineſſe there can be no perfect patience.</note> becauſe he was godly. Here vppon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie may be concluded, that without pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or godlineſſe, there can bee no good and perfect patience.</p>
               <p>This doctrine was well knowne vnto Saint Peter: therefore as ſoone as hee hath exhorted vs vnto patience, preſently hee ſaith, ioyne vnto your patience godlyneſſe: as if hee ſhould ſay: vnleſſe ye bee religious <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1, 6.</note> and godly, ye cannot be patient. Godlineſſe therfore is the biginner, maintainer and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter of patience.</p>
               <p>Now what it is to liue godly, and how a godly man is to be knowne, wee may aboue <note place="margin">Who is a godly man.</note> learne from the mouth of God. For if Iob were a godly man, as doubtleſſe he was, then to liue godly is to liue vprightly and iuſtly, to feare GOD, and eſchew euill. All this did Iob. This deſcription of a godly man, is the ſame in effect that Saint Paule ſayth, <note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.</note> The grace of GOD (which bringeth ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) teacheth, namely to denie all vngodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and worldly luſts, and to liue ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, righteouſlye, and godly in this preſent world.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:13012:73"/>
To denie all vngodlineſſe and worldly luſts, is with Iob, to eſchew euill: to liue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, is with Iob, to liue vprightly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our ſelues: to liue righteouſly, is with Iob, to liue iuſtly in reſpect of our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with others: to liue godly, is with Iob, to feare GOD, that is to liue religiouſly in his feare, honouring and worſhiping his name, according to his will. So then wee plainely ſee what it is to liue godly, namely <note place="margin">True religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition.</note> to be religious without ſuperſtition, to bee ſober in our liues and conuerſation without hypocriſie, and to deale truely and plainely with all men, in ſimplicitie: who ſo doeth this, is ſurely a godly man.</p>
               <p>The which thing that we ſhould with all care endeauour to performe, is the meaning of Saint Peter, when hee ſayth, Ioyne vnto your patience godlineſſe. Pietie or godlines vpholdeth patience, for the patience which <note place="margin">The wicked haue pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced.</note> the wicked ſeeme to haue, is patience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced as we ſaye, and is not true patience, but rather impatiencie. Therefore Sainte Peter ſayth, We muſt ioyne pietie or godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to our patience, as if hee ſhould ſaye: there cannot bee a patient man exceept the ſeede of true Religion and godlineſſe bee firſt planted in his heart: for what is the cauſe that wicked worldly men and women, doe ſo fret and fume, and chafe at euerye
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13012:74"/>
ſtorme of aduerſitie, but becauſe they are <note place="margin">Want of Religion &amp; godlines the cauſe of all impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie.</note> not religious and godly? On the other ſide, we ſee that the faithfull and godly haue and doe ſuffer all troubles and aduerſities pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and with contented mindes.</p>
               <p>What made Abraham, Iſaack, Iacob, and the Patryarkes, Moyſes and the reſt of the Prophets, Saint Steuen, Saint Iames and all the reſt of the Apoſtles, together with all the reſt of the Martyrs, in the ten firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and ſince, to bee ſo patient in all their tryals and afflictions, and ſpecially at the time of their death, but becauſe they had true Religion, pietie, and godlyneſſe? Godlineſſe therefore ſurely ſupporteth and holdeth vs within the bonds of patience, that we breake not out with the wicked into all impatiencie. Therefore is it that Sainte Peter exhorteth vs, to ioyne with patience godlineſſe.</p>
               <p>Godlineſſe then aboue all things, ought to bee deſired, for it is a ſurpaſsing treaſure <note place="margin">Godlineſſe aboue all things ought to be deſired. 1. Tim. 6.9</note> that neuer periſheth. Godlineſſe ſaith Saint Paule is great gaine, if a man bee content with that he hath, for we brught nothing into this world, and it is certein, wee ſhall carrye nothing with vs. Againe he ſaith, godlineſſe is profitable to all things: it hath the promiſe of this life preſent, and of that that is to come.

Thus <hi>I</hi> ſay, euery one of theſe vertues do in a ſpecial &amp; peculiar ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerprofite themſelues that are endued with them.</p>
               <p>But becauſe man is not borne alone for himſelfe, (as heathen men alſo haue taught) and therefore muſt not onely haue vertues to benefite himſelfe, but alſo
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13012:79"/>
ſuch as wherewith hee may doo good to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Therefore Saint Peter biddeth vs to ioyne with the other forenamed vertues, firſt brotherly kindnes, which is a moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent <note place="margin">2. Pet: 1. 7.

For this cauſe then is it, that Saint Peter doth not bring loue and brotherly kindnes together within the compaſſe of one linke, but ſpeaketh of them ſeuerally &amp; diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet lincketh them one in the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can bee no brotherlie kindnes where there is no loue, nor any true loue where there is not brotherlie kindneſſe.

people and infidels, yea, and alſo many of them which beare the names of chriſtians ſhewe great kindnes one to the other, not becauſe they are chriſtians, &amp; of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of faith (for that is the leaſt thing they account of) but for ſome other cauſe, and in ſome other reſpecte.<label type="milestone">

                  </label> I anſwere, that this kind of loue and affection may alſo in a ſort bee called brotherly kindnes, to wit, as we are brothers by creation.

               <p>Now for as much as naturall kindenes was before brotherly kindnes, and becauſe brotherly kindnes wherevnto Saint Peter exhorteth vs, doth not take a way naturall kindnes, but rather ſeeketh to repaire na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thorough grace: therefore I thinke it not amiſſe, in this chapter to ſpeake firſt of naturall kindnes, and how wee do degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heerein contrary to our kinde and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then to come to this chriſtian brotherlie kindnes that Saint Peter ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, which doth excell and exceede the other by many degrees: ſhewing withall

the want of this brotherlie kindnes, which doth too much bewray it ſelfe euen among thoſe countryes and nations which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Firſt then concerning naturall kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, wee maye conſider the greate and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſedome of almightie GOD, as in all thinges, ſo eſpeciallye in this one thing, forming in numerable ſortes of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures wherwith the whole world is reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, <note place="margin">Gen<hi>:</hi> 1, 24 Nature hath taught all beaſts to loue theyr kind.</note> infuſed into eache creature this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete force of nature, that euerie one ſhoulde loue and liue together with ſuch as were beſt like the one vnto the other.

                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:13012:81"/>
Now what doth all this teach and preach vnto vs, but that man which was made Lord <note place="margin">Man taught his duty by vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> &amp; gouernour ouer all theſe other creatures, ſhould keepe ſtill that ſame force of nature which was alſo giuen him in his kind, to liue mutually together one with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other? for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Adam was formed of the duſt of the earth, euen nature no doubt taught him this, that of all the creatures in the world, there were none made like vnto man, I meane in ſhape and fairenes of bodye (to ſpeake nothing of <note place="margin">Gen<hi>:</hi> 2. 20.</note> the ſoule which is the chefeſt parte of man) which Adam could find in his hart to chuſe for an equall make and companion with him.

Thus when nothing coulde bee found <note place="margin">Gen: 2<hi>:</hi> 18.</note> fit to keepe Adam companye, God of his great mercy made one of Adams owne fleſh and bone like vnto him. onely differing in ſex, whereby mankind might bee alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the world thereby repleniſhed.</p>
               <p>Of theſe twaine ſo liking &amp; louing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they were like of body, like of <note place="margin">Adam and Eue fit company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſpeech, and like of mind, hath ſprung all the increaſe of mankind in whatſoeuer country

or nation now they are remayning. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one hath a ſecrete force of nature in himſelfe, to loue &amp; like one another: which kinde of affection, is called naturall kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or if you will, brotherly naturall kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <note place="margin">Naturall brotherlie kindnes.</note> as we are brothers by creation, how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer man in this pointe, hath degenerated out of kinde, more then all other creatures in the world.</p>
               <p>Nature hath taught all beaſtes to loue their like, &amp; nature hath taught men to loue <note place="margin">Many men more vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall than brute beaſts</note> one another: Whereſoeuer thou ſeeſt man, which is thy fleſhe, thou oughteſt for that cauſe to loue him, and to ſhewe brotherlie kindnes vnto him, Bee hee Turke, Iewe, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian, Scythyan, Grecian, or of any other nation or country vnder heauen, nature (if thou bee not more vnnaturall then a beaſt) hath taught thee to ſhew the kindnes of a man vnto him: and to do him any good thou canſt.

O would to God this force of nature were not quenched in vs, then ſhould not ſo many pitifull and diſtreſſed creatures lie vnholpen &amp; vnreleeued of ſuch as are well able to releeue them. This onely thing doth plainely declare, that man doth more degenerate and growe out of kinde in this point, then either the beaſtes of the field, or birds of the aire, which will louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helpe one another, and ſhew kindnes one to another: the ſame I ſaye ſhould one man do for another, of what nation or countrye ſoeuer hee bee<hi>:</hi> for nature it ſelfe doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs therevnto, to ſhewe the kindnes of a man one to the other.</p>

of the whole body of that countrye or weale publique.

               <p>None of theſe thinges, I ſaie, is againſt the lawe of nature, which teacheth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man to ſhewe brotherlye kindneſſe,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13012:83"/>
yea the magiſtrate as well as any other: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to ſpeak all in a word, it is not <note place="margin">Not the magiſtrate but the law that putteth malefactors to death.</note> the magiſtrate but the law that putteth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors to death. Wherefore, this force of nature doeth ſtill remaine vntaken awaye, that brotherly kindnes muſt be ſhewed one to another, as wee are all men made by one workmaſter, of one mettall though caſt in diuers moldes.</p>
               <p>Now that one man doth loue his owne <note place="margin">degrees of brotherly kindnes.</note> country men better then another, and in that country his kindred before other, and in that kindred his owne familie before an other, and in that family, his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before other, it commeth alſo to paſſe by the ſecrete force of nature. For as in birds, beaſtes, and fiſhes, though birds will company with birds, &amp; beaſts with beaſts, and ſo forth, yet euerie of them haue their ſeuerall fellowſhips, as before wee haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So likewiſe though in generallitie, man will company with man, and in a ſorte ſhewe kindnes one to another, yet nature hath her working in vs alſo, euen in this, that by how much more we are lincked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by any bonde of familiaritie and friendſhip, of countrie, or kindred, by ſo much more wee will ſhewe kindnes one to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, for that in deed is right brotherlie <note place="margin">True bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> kindnes, and moſt agreeable vnto nature. For as we cannot ſhewe kindnes to all men at one time, ſo it were vnnaturall (and ſuch vnnaturall wretches there are many in this
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13012:83"/>
land) to be vnkind vnto our owne country <note place="margin">Vnkind countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that will helpe other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries rather then their owne.</note> men, kindred, neighbours and friends, and to ſeeke opportunity to ſhew kindnes vnto other countries, or to them wee neuer ſawe before. This you will ſaye is kindnes, but it is vnnaturall kindneſſe, ſuch as is odious before God and man.</p>
               <p>Now, as there are ſome which turne naturall into vnnaturall kindneſſe, ſo the moſt part of people that are irreligious and liuing in this declining age of the world, are growen ſo barbarous, hard harted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane and brutiſh, inſomuch that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this naturall kindneſſe is almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in them. And if I may ſpeake by waye of compariſon, we ſhall finde that not onely bruite beaſtes do excell many men in this natural kindnes one toward the other, but alſo in declaring their naturall affection vnto man, more then one man ſometimes doth vnto another. Fewe natural men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out religion and godlines doe loue theyr wiues as the turtle doth his make: no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man can ſhewe more kindnes vnto her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, then the Pellicane doth to her young; If vnreaſonable creatures can match, nay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermatch many of vs in theſe two pointes of natural kindnes, then what ſhal we thinke of the reſt?</p>
               <p>Againe, hiſtories do record what great affection brutiſhe beaſtes haue ſhewed vnto mankinde. Pliny reporteth that in the cittie of Ceſton an Eagle being brought vp by a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13012:84"/>
young maide, loued the maide ſo well, that it woulde flye abroad and kill foules and bring them home to the damſell, and when ſhe died the Eagle died with her. As ſtrange a thing as this wee reade of an Elephant which was in the warres at what time Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus ſubdued the citie of Argos, which ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant after hee perceiued that his maiſter was ſlaine, went vp and downe among the dead ſoldiers, to ſeeke his maiſter, which being founde, the Elephant brought his bodye being dead to a ſafe place, where the Elephant after much mourning, dyed for ſorow. What ſhould I ſpeak of the affection and naturall kindeneſſe that horſes and dogges do ſhewe vnto their maiſters? wee do daylie ſee ſomething before our eyes, but hiſtories do reporte much more.</p>
               <p>Of Horſes, that Alexander king of Macedon, that Iulius Caeſar Emperour of Rome, that Antiochus king of Siria, had each of them a horſe, who bearing vnto their maiſters ſuch affection, would ſuffer no other to ride vppon them but onelye their maiſters, vnto whome they would crouch and kneele downe to the ground to receiue them vppon their backes. It would bee too long to rehearſe the tenth hiſtorie that doth recorde the kindenes which dogges haue ſhewen vnto their maiſters; Liſimachus that noble Grecian, had a dog named Durides, that loued him ſo well,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13012:84"/>
that euen at Liſimachus death, the dog di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo. Hiero had another dogge, that ran willinglie into that flame of fire where his maiſter did burne, and ſo dyed with him. Titus Sabinus dogge, as Fulgotius ſaith, neuer forſooke his maiſter in priſon: when any one gaue the dogge bread or meat, hee brought it vnto his maiſter in priſon, and when his maiſter was thrown into the riuer Tyber, the dogge was ſeene to doe what hee coulde to lifte vp his maiſters heade out of the water, thinking his maiſter had bene aliue.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other ſuch do writers reporte of the kind affection that bruite beaſts do beare vnto mankinde, which I haue noted onely to this ende, that theſe monſters in nature, and not men, may bee aſhamed to ſee howe farre they degenerate from that naturall kindnes which was once giuen vnto them; when they ſhall ſee euen bruite beaſtes to excell them therein.</p>
               <p>The want of this naturall kindneſſe is is not the leaſt cauſe of ſo many vnnaturall murthers, villanyes, and conſpiracies in the world. And if this naturall kindnes were of force among vs, though ſome care neither for God nor religion (as a great many doo not) yet they woulde not bee ſo vnkinde, as in the hardenes of theyr heartes to tourne awaye theyr faces from theyr owne fleſhe, which many times they ſee

readie to periſh for want of thinges neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, whome they might well releeue wyth their ſuperfluitie. Inſomuch, that though it was once ſayde, <hi>Homo homini Deus,</hi> that man ſhoulde bee louing as God vnto man. Yet now it is proued contrarie in a great many, that <hi>Homo homini, non lupus</hi> (as the Prouerbe is) <hi>ſed daemon,</hi> Men rage not like wolues, but more like deuils one againſt another. And the longer wee liue, the worſe: one age is more hatefull than another, and this age ſeemeth to ſhew leſſe naturall kindnes than former ages.</p>
               <p>For who ſeeth not, or rather what hart la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth not, to ſee how this natural kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes which ſhould be between man &amp; man, doth cool &amp; decay daily? Is it not now come to this paſſe among a great many, that one man is not regarded of another, that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men diſdaine one the other, that kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reproch the one the other, that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours deceiue one the other, that no man will truſt one another, no, not his brother? Subiects are diſloyall towards their prince, children are vnnaturall towardes theyr pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, people haue no heartie loue towards theyr paſtours, many paſtours loue more the fleeces than their ſheepe, euerie man loues himſelfe, fewe of the common ſorte care as they ſhoulde for the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of theyr Countrie. Thus hath ſelfe loue euen banniſhed naturall loue and kindnes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:13012:86"/>
out of our coaſtes. I ſpeake yet ſtill of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall kindnes, as wee are brothers by nature and creation.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch, that moſt certainly we now liue in thoſe laſt dayes and perillous times which the Apoſtle S. Paule forepropheſied <note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.1</note> ſhoulde come before the end of the world, when men ſhoulde bee louers of their owne ſelues, couetous, boaſters, proude, curſed ſpeakers, diſobedient to parents, vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vnholye, without naturall affection, truce breakers, falſe accuſers, intemperate, fierce, deſpiſers of them which are good, traitours, headye, high minded, louers of pleaſures more than louers of God, hauing a ſhew of holyneſſe, but hauing denyed the power thereof, all which thinges are moſt certainly fulfilled in our time.</p>
               <p>But leauing to diſcourſe farther of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall kindneſſe, and of ſuch vnkinde natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men as this age yeeldeth, I muſt come to the chiefeſt thing that ought to bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in this Chapter, euen vnto chriſtian brotherly kindnes, which the Apoſtle Saint Peter in anie caſe woulde haue vs to linke vnto the ſixe former vertues, for Chriſtians muſt not onelye ſhewe brotherly kindneſſe one to another, becauſe wee are brothers by nature and creation, but chiefelye and principally, becauſe wee are alſo brothers by grace of redemption, by profeſsion and religion, becauſe wee haue one God, one
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:13012:87"/>
faith, one baptiſme, one ſauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And is this brotherhoode neerer and dearer than the other? O farre dearer: by nature and creation we are brothers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, but by grace wee are knit <note place="margin">Brothers by redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nearer and dearer then by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> together in vnitie of ſpirite: by nature wee inioye heere in a fraternitie, the temporall thinges of this worlde, (and that neyther but by vſurpation or tolleration) but by grace wee inioy through hope, thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable riches which ſhall neuer fade. By na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are the ſonnes of men, but by grace wee are made the ſonnes of God, The ſame ſpirite bearing witneſſe with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God. If wee bee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <note place="margin">Rom: 8.16.17.</note> wee are alſo heires, euen the heires of God, and heirs annexed with Chriſt, if ſo be that wee ſuffer with him, that wee maye alſo bee gloryfied wyth him. By nature wee are heires heere of temporall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances, but by grace wee are heires and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heires wyth Chriſt Ieſus of eternall glorie<hi>:</hi> in a worde, by nature, or rather by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, we are the children of wrath and damnation, but by grace wee are reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto life and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>If by nature therefore wee ought to ſhewe kindneſſe to our brothers, according vnto the fleſh, howe much more vnto them that are brothers both by nature &amp; profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</p>
               <p>This Argument, from the leſſer to the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13012:87"/>
greater, doeth the Apoſtle Saint Paule vſe, when hee would perſwade his beloued Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon, <note place="margin">Brothers both by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Phile: 16.</note> to ſhewe kindneſſe vnto Oneſimus, an old ſeruant of Philemons: I beſeech thee (ſayth the holy Apoſtle Saint Paule) for my ſonne Oneſimus, whome I haue begotten in my bondes, that thou wouldeſt receiue him for euer: not nowe as a ſeruant, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue a ſeruant, euen a brother beloued, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie to mee, howe much more to thee, both in the fleſh, and in the Lorde.</p>
               <p>Heere then was brotherly kindneſſe to bee ſhewed, both becauſe Oneſimus was once Philemons ſeruant, and of his familye; in which reſpect, Saint Paule (as the learned doo note) doeth call Oneſimus Philemons brother, according to the fleſhe, as alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee was now a brother, according vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, as there are degrees of brotherly kindneſſe, according to nature, ſo alſo according to grace: for though loue, (whereof wee muſt ſpeake in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) <note place="margin">Degrees of brotherlie kindnes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to grace.</note> doeth extende it ſelfe farre and neere to all the children of God alike, that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpearſed thoroughout the whole worlde, yet chriſtian brotherly kindnes, doth ſhewe it ſelfe by degrees (which ſheweth a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene loue and brotherly kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) according to country, kindered, affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, fellowſhip, and ſo foorth. It was godly
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13012:88"/>
brotherly kindnes in Moiſes, ſo earneſtly to pray the Lord to pardon his country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Exod. 32.31</note> the children of Iſrael, (though therein he had chiefely reſpect vnto Gods glory) or els to raſe his name out of the booke of life. In like maner it was chriſtian brotherly kindnes in Saint Paule, to wiſhe himſelfe <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 3.</note> ſeparated from Chriſt for his brethren that were his kinſemen according to the fleſh: And the ſame brotherly kindnes haue all the faithfull (though not in ſo great a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) euen vnto this daye. The faithfull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band doth chiefelie deſire the ſaluation <note place="margin">The fruites of brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kindnes.</note> of his wife, the wife lykewiſe of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande: faithfull parents, the ſaluation of their children, children ought to beare the ſame affection vnto their parents; ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and ſiſters, ſo neighbours and friends, ſo kinſtolke &amp; countrey folke, ſhould beare this Chriſtian brotherly kindnes one to the other. For theſe vertues which wee had firſt giuen vnto vs by creation, are not taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by grace of redemption, but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. Therefore Saint Paule ſaith, Be ye af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned, <note place="margin">Giftes of nature re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtored by grace of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</note> to loue one the other with bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindnes. And the author to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues faith, Let brotherly loue continue. And againe, forſake not the fellowſhip that ye haue among your ſelues, as the manner <note place="margin">Heb: 12. 1.</note> of ſome is. And Saint Peter in the ſecond Chapter of his firſt Epiſtle ſaith, Honour <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.17.</note> all men, loue brotherlie fellowſhip.
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:13012:88"/>
Therefore the ſaintes of God in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church, are commended in the third of <note place="margin">Act. 3.42.</note> the Actes, becauſe they did continue not onely in the Apoſtles doctrine, but alſo in <note place="margin">Chriſtians ſhould liue together in godly fellowſhip.</note> fellowſhip. If theſe Chriſtians were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, for that they continued in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine and fellowſhip: howe are many that beare the names of Chriſtians in this age to be condemned, for that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree neyther in the Apoſtles doctrine, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in brotherly kindnes, and Chriſtian fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip: but deuide &amp; ſeparate themſelues one from the other?</p>
               <p>How are all the nations in Chriſtendome deuided and rent aſunder the one from the other? (a token that the latter day draweth <note place="margin">The bonds of Chriſtian fellowſhip broken.</note> neer) Are not almoſt al the bonds of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fellowſhip, &amp; brotherly kindneſſe broken?

Surely it is moſt certaine, that Antechriſt that ſpirituall whore of Babilon, hath not onely made drunken the moſt part of the Kinges and Princes of the earth, with the cup of her

               <p>The Turkes and Saraſens, neede not trouble themſelues to make warre againſt Chriſtendome, for wee haue them that by name and profeſſion are Chriſtians, which doe trauel in paine, (as a woman ready to be deliuered, till they heare or ſee all chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome together by the eares.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is the manner of cunning and curious golde-ſinithes, that worke onely vpon fine and pure gold, euermore to put vnto their worke, ſome priuie ſigne or marke, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they will know their owne doinges from others, that vſe not ſo fine gold as they doe. The very ſame thing (in a ſorte) our ſkilfull and perfect workeman Sainte Peter ſeemeth to doe, in this excellent peece of worke now in hand, he hath beaten out all his linckes of the pureſt and fineſt golde, hee hath ſo curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lincked one lincke in the other, &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uited the ſame faſt with the hammer of Gods worde, that it cannot bee perceiued where the ſoldering is. Now being about <note place="margin">Saint Peters chaine, made all of pure gold.</note> to finiſh his chaine, he addeth this laſt linck of loue vnto it, which ſerueth him as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie ſigne or marke to know this chaine made all of purified gold, from all other mens worke, that ſhall goe about to counterfaite the ſame with any baſe golde, or copper that hath not beene tried by the perfecte touchſtone of the word of God, nor weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edin the ballance of the ſanctuary.</p>
               <p>And this is done ſurely to great purpoſe,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:13012:92"/>
for as no golde-ſmith be he neuer ſo skilful, can make any worke of his fineſt golde, but ſome ſhifting mates or other, will counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite the ſame in Copper, and double-gilde it ouer with golde, in ſuch ſort that (except it betryed two or three times by the touch) it ſhall not appeare that it is counterfaite. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo Sainte Peter, knowing that there <note place="margin">Many coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>terfaiters of vertue in the world.</note> would ariſe many ſuch deceauers in the laſt age of the world, that would counterfait his Chaine, making ſhew to the world, that they haue faith, vertue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godlines, and brotherly kindnes, when in truth (being tryed by the touch it is nothing ſo) hee therefore (me thinketh) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of ſet purpoſe, vnto his Chaine this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">True loue can hardly be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faited. A ſimilitud</note> linke of loue, which cannot well bee coloured or counterfaited. For as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melion, can chaunge himſelfe into any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, except it be white, ſo the wicked impes of Sathan, can counterfaite euery vertue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be loue and charitie: the which thing when they would alſo goe about to doe, the heate of their malicious ſtomaks euer more be wraie them, by this lincke then of loue &amp; charitie, it ſhall appeare, who are truely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and who are counterfaite hypocrites, and diſſemblers.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, this loue whereunto Saint Peter here exhorteth vs, is a true note wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the children of God are knowne, and a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:13012:93"/>
badge which euerye Chriſtian ought to <note place="margin">Loue the badge of Chriſtians</note> weare. Therefore loue may bee called the badge of Chriſtians. Noble and gentlemen wee ſee, (that their retinue, and attendants may be knowne) when they receiue any man into their ſeruice, giue them a badge or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance. Euerie ſouldier in the fielde, <note place="margin">Similies.</note> knoweth of what band he is, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enſigne that is borne before him.

Peter ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of. By this (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall all men <note place="margin">Ioh. 13.35</note> know that yee are my Diſciples, if yee loue one an other. This badge of loue muſt bee plated faſt, not in the ſleeue, but in the harts of Chriſtians: the Mettal whereof this badge <note place="margin">Loue muſt be in the hearte.</note> of loue is made, doth farre exceede al golde or ſiluer, for golde will not appeare if it bee couered with any other thing, but loue the cloſer it is hid in the heart, the brighter wil it ſhine throughout all the parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Like vnto a precious ſtone called the Topaze, that glittereth or ſhineth beſt in the <note place="margin">Loue like vnto a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone that ſhineth beſt in the darke.</note> darke. And indeed how can it be otherwiſe? Can it bee darke in that houſe where the Sunne ſhineth in through the Glaſſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes?
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13012:93"/>
Nay, can that place of the firmament bee darke where the Sunne abideth? No verily: much leſſe can that ſoule and body of man be dark, where God himſelfe which is all light remaineth.</p>
               <p>Now God is loue, as ſaith Saint Iohn, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.7.</note> let vs loue one an other, for loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of God, euery one that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God: contrariwiſe, he that loueth not, knoweth not God, for God is loue. Againe, he ſaith, No man hath ſeene <note place="margin">8.</note> GOD at any time; if wee loue one another God dwelleth in vs, and his loue is perfect <note place="margin">Verſ. 12.</note> in vs. Againe, he ſaith, God is loue, and hee that dwelleth in loue dwelleth in God, and <note place="margin">16.</note> and God in him. What diuine and heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing then is Chriſtian loue and charitie? How doth this one lincke beautifie this gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Chaine? Who would not bee in loue with ſuch a Iewell, where God himſelfe is engrauen in the middeſt? Many thinke they <note place="margin">Loue a principall Iewell.</note> are ſafe, when they haue a Crucifixe of gold, ſiluer or copper hanging about their neckes, though their harts be ful of hatred, ſinne and mallice. But O beloued, here is a rich and precious Iewell worthie the wearing<hi>:</hi> the Crucifixe, is but a fayned and falſe picture of the body of Chriſt, whereby if thou take <note place="margin">Crucifixe dangerous.</note> not heede, thou mayeſt ſoone commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13012:94"/>
in thine hart, then thou needeſt not feare the force of thine enemies, for thou haſt God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding with thee, and if God be with thee, who can preuaile againſt thee? There bee <note place="margin">Rom. 2 31.</note> indeede poore Politicians nowe a daies, which think it good policie (but it is againſt Diuinitie) though thou bee no Papiſt, (but percaſe a Newter, or an Atheiſt) to haue a <note place="margin">Poyſonfull pollititians.</note> Crucifixe alwaies hanging about thy neckes for, ſay they, if the Spaniards, who are poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Papiſts, ſhould inuade this land, they will vſe thee well, for thy Crucifixe ſake.

               <p>Surely this fearefulnes that is in the harts of people, as it doth argue great wickednes, and guiltineſſe of their conſciences, ſo it is a <note place="margin">A guiltie conſcience cannot be bold.

Iohn ſaith, herein is loue perfect in vs, that we ſhould haue boldnes, (not onely in this life againſt our enemies but alſo) in the day of iudgement. Againe he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13012:94"/>
ſaith, There is no feare in loue, but perfecte <note place="margin">18.</note> loue caſteth out feare, and hee that feareth is not perfect in loue: if therefore thou wilt not be afraide of thine enemies in this life, nor of damnation in the life to come, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Loue caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out fere.</note> true loue and Charitie in thine hearte and mind, Loue God aboue al, &amp; thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thy ſelfe: for therein conſiſteth the <note place="margin">Mat. 22.37.</note> whole law and the Prophets, as our Sauiour Chriſt doth witneſſe. And Saint Paul ſaith, <note place="margin">Rom. 13.9.</note> the Law is fulfilled in one word, Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe. Againe, loue hurteth not his neighbour, therefore is loue the fulfilling of the law. We muſt therefore <note place="margin">Gala. 5.14.</note> loue God aboue all, and our neighbours as our ſelues.</p>
               <p>There be ſome indeede that wil ſay, they <note place="margin">We cannot loue God if we hate our brethren.</note> loue God, and yet will hate their brethren, but that cannot be: if we loue God, we will ſurely loue our neighbour: if wee hate our neighbour, we hate God alſo. This is cleare by the words of Saint Iohn; whoſe Sermons ſauour al of loue: if any man ſay I loue God, <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.20</note> and yet hate his brother, he is a lyer, for how can he that loueth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, Loue God whome hee hath not ſeene. And this commaundement haue wee of Chriſt, that hee that loueth God, ſhould <note place="margin">21.</note> loue his brother alſo. Againe hee ſaith, In this are the children of God knowne, and the children of the Deuil: Whoſoeuer doth <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.10</note>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:13012:95"/>
not righteouſneſſe is not of God, neither he that loueth not his brother. O then beloued I am afraide that the deuill hath a greate many more children heere among vs then <note place="margin">Chriſtians by name but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede.</note> God hath: for though we be all called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet there is litle Chriſtian loue among vs, but olde mallice, deadly hatred, bitter enuying, contention, ſtriuing, lawing, quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling, fighting, murdering, both with hand heart and tongue. O theſe are not the fruits of the ſpirit! But loue, and peace, and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and gentleneſſe, they are the fruites of <note place="margin">Gala. 5.</note> the ſpirite, the other are the markes of the children of Sathan, who hath euermore borne deadly hatred to Gods children, and and hath beenea lyer and a murderer, from the beginning.</p>
               <p>Therefore Saint Iohn ſaith, Hee that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his brother is a murderer. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt ſaith, whoſoeuer is angrie with <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.15</note> his brother vnaduiſedlye is culpable of iudgement. As loue therefore is the badge <note place="margin">Mat. 5.22.</note> of Chriſtians, ſo hatred and mallice are the proper notes of Sathans broode, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <note place="margin">Hatred and mallice Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans recog<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſcences.</note> of darkeneſſe. As fire and water can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not agree togeather, no more can loue and hatred remaine in one man: one fountaine cannot bring foorth ſalt water and ſweete: a good tree cannot bring foorth bad fruite: therefore Saint Iames ſaith, Who ſo is a wiſe <note place="margin">Iam. 3.11 12.</note> man, and indued with knowledge: Let him
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13012:95"/>
ſhew by good conuerſation his workes in <note place="margin">13.</note> meekenes of wiſedome: but if yee haue bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enuying, &amp; ſtrife in your harts, this wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome deſcendeth not from aboue, but is earthly, ſenſual and deuiliſh, for wher enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">14.</note> and ſtrife is, there is ſedition and al ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of euil workes: but the wiſedome that is <note place="margin">15.</note> from aboue, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, eaſie to be intreated, full of mercie and <note place="margin">16.</note> good fruites; without iudging and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hypocriſie: and the fruite of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">17.</note> is ſowne in peace, of them that make peace. <note place="margin">18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, as I haue ſaid, theſe inwarde grudgings and bitter contentions betweene profeſſed Chriſtians, are euident tokens, that there is great want of this loue and charitie among vs. Loue, ſayth Salomon, (and it is <note place="margin">Prou. 10.12</note> repeated againe by Sainte Peter) doeth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a multitude of ſinnes, if any therfore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce <note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.8.</note> in blazing abroade the faults of their brethren, howe haue they this loue within <note place="margin">Loue coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth many faults. Gala. 6.1.2,</note> them? We ought rather to follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Saint Paul, to ſupport one the other with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe, conſidering that no man is free from temptations. The <note place="margin">The nature and office of true loue 1. Cor. 13.1</note> nature and office of this true loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, is excellently ſet forth by Saint Paule in the thirteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinths: for there the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that al other gifts, as the gift of tongues, <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:13012:96"/>
propheſie, knowledge, and the reſt, without loue are nothing worth. Againe, If any would giue his body to bee burned, and all his goods to the poore, without loue it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing. If any ſay, to giue our goods to the poore, is a fruite of loue and charitie, I confeſſe it, and it is a doctrine needfull to bee vrged in theſe daies of dearth and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurie (when Lazarus craueth, and Diues hoardeth) to teach and exhorte all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <note place="margin">3.</note> vnto liberalitie, to charge them that are rich in this world (vppon paine of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) that they truſt not in vncertaine riches, but in the liuing God, which giueth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly <note place="margin">Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto charitie moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie.</note> all things to enioye. That they be good and be rich in good woorkes, ready to giue and to diſtribute to them that haue neede, Laying vp in ſtore for themſelues a <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17</note> good foundation, againſt the time to come, that they may obtaine eternall life. For hee that giueth to the poore lendeth vnto the Lord, and looke what he layeth out, it ſhall <note place="margin">18.</note> be paide him againe with aduantage: this is godly Vſurie, this is to hoard vp riches in heauen: Bleſſed is the man that prouideth for the poore and needie.

               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:13012:96"/>
Notwithſtanding, though this doctrine, I ſay, be true and needfull to be vrged conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, yet it is true alſo, that wee may giue al our goods to the poore, and yet want loue and charitie. For, to giue our goods to ſome <note place="margin">We muſt giue our Almeswith out partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie.</note> poore which wee loue and like, and in our hartes to hate (with a deadly hatred) others, which are alſo our owne fleſh, proceedeth not of loue, but of natural kindneſſe; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with infidels and heathen people are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Againe, we may giue our goods vaine gloriouſly, or in hope of meriting. Therefore is it that Saint Paul ſaith, Though thou giue <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.3</note> al thy goods to the poore, and haue no loue, it profiteth thee nothing. And our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith, that we muſt not only loue and <note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note> doe good to them that loue vs (for ſo the wickedſt men in the world do,) but we muſt <note place="margin">To loue our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not of nature but of grace Rom. 12</note> loue and doe good to our enemies, which thing commeth not of nature, but of grace. If thine enemie hunger, feede him: if he thirſt, giue him drinke. O, this is hard, to hard har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted people, but God will haue thee to doe this: if thou be his child, loue will bring this to paſſe, &amp; till thou canſt doe this in ſome meaſure; thou mayeſt feare to call God Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore Chriſt ſayth, I ſay vnto you, Loue your enemies, bleſſe them that curſe <note place="margin">Mat. 5.44.</note> you, pray for them which hate and perſecute you. Why ſhall we doe all this? Chriſt aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, that ye may be the children of your
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13012:97"/>
heauenly Father, for hee maketh the Sunne <note place="margin">45.</note> to riſe vpon the euill and the good, and his raine to fall vppon the iuſt and vniuſt. On the contrarie, ſaith Chriſt, if yee loue them that loue you, what reward ſhall yee haue, doe not the Publicans euen the ſame? Be ye <note place="margin">46.</note> perfect therefore (in loue) euen as your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father is perfect. To giue our goods <note place="margin">47.</note> only to ſuch poore as we loue and like, ſuch as we know wil blaze the ſame abroade, and to hate other whome we ſhould loue, is not to be perfect, but partiall in loue, and ſo for ſuch loue we ſhal haue no thanke of GOD. We haue ſpoken before of brotherly-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that doeth keepe it ſelfe within ſome limites, but this Loue wherof now we ſpeake hath no bounds but extendeth it ſelfe ouer <note place="margin">Loue hath no bounds.</note> all the world, euen to our verie enemies. He that cannot loue his enemies for Chriſts ſake is not perfect in loue. God loued vs when we were his enemies, wee muſt follow God in this reſpect. Be followers of God, ſaith <note place="margin">Rom. 5.6.</note> Saint Paul, and walke in loue, euen as Chriſt hath loued vs, and ſo forth. Beloued ſaith <note place="margin">Eph. 5.1.</note> Saint Iohn, If God ſo loued vs, we ought alſo to loue one another. The loue that God hath <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.11</note> ſhewed vnto vs is infinite, and vnmeaſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wee muſt therefore endeauour to loue God, and our enemies for his ſake in ſome <note place="margin">We muſt loue our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God loued vs being his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</note> meaſure. Or elſe, Woe, Woe be vnto vs. We muſt loue God, becauſe hee loued vs firſt,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13012:97"/>
and wee muſt loue our enemies for Gods ſake, becauſe he loued vs when we were his enemies.</p>
               <p>This doctrine by how much more it is hard for fleſh and bloud to performe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt our fleſhly nature, which is euermore deſirous of reuenge, by ſo much <note place="margin">If we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgiue we muſt pray God to change our hearts.

If yee forgiue not other their treſpaſſes, no more wil your hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Father forgiue you your treſpaſſes. <note place="margin">Mat. 6.15.</note> Therefore Chriſtians are taught daylye to pray the Lord to forgiue them, as they doe <note place="margin">Mat. 6.12.</note> forgiue others, that is, if wee doe not forgiue others, then wee deſire the Lord not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs, which is moſt fearefull, if wee haue any grace to conſider ofit. This then is to be <note place="margin">When wee pray &amp; doe not forgiue we ſinne grieuouſly.</note> perfect in loue (as farre as we can attaine to perfection in this life) to loue God with all our harts, with all our ſoules and with al our ſtrength, &amp; our neighbour, though our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, as our ſelus. The which thing, becauſe no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can do in ſuch abſolute ſort as he ought, therefore we cannot bee perfect in loue, til <note place="margin">We<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot be perfect in loue in this life.</note> we haue laide down our fleſhly nature, &amp; be clothed with immortalitie: but we muſt doe the beſt we can: and though we cannot loue

God and our neighbors, as we ſhould, yet we muſt forgiue our enemies freely as wee are commanded: yea, &amp; loue them, euen as our deareſt frendes: though they bee our mortal enemies, and haue ſworne our death, yet wee muſt loue them, (not with a fayned <note place="margin">We muſt pray for our enemies. Luk. 23.24. Act. 7.60.</note> but true Chriſtian loue) and praye for them, that God woulde change their harts, and forgiue them, euen as Chriſt, and Saint Stephen prayed for their perſecutors, ſaying, <note place="margin">To forgiue iniuries, is giuen vnto vs of God.</note> Lorde lay not this ſinne to their charge. This loue which cauſeth vs to ſuffer iniuries patiently, and to forgiue them freely, is the ſpeciall gift of God, and giuen onely to his <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.4.</note> elect. Therefore Saint Paule ſaith, Loue ſuffereth long, and is curteous: Loue enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">5.</note> not, loue doth not boaſt it ſelfe, it ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, it diſdayneth not, it ſeeketh not her <note place="margin">6.</note> owne things, it is not prouoked to anger, it <note place="margin">7.</note> thinketh no euill, it reioyceth not in iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but reioyceth in the truth, it ſuffereth all thinges, it beleeueth all things, it hopeth all thinges, and indureth all thinges: Why then, he that hath this lincke of loue, hath <note place="margin">Loue hath all vertues included in it.</note> all theſe vertues included in it: O rich chain, where one lincke is bedecked with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precious pearles: contrariwiſe then it muſt needes follow, that they which can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no iniuries, they that are of a curriſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not curteous, they that enuy at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens good ſucceſſe, &amp; proſperitie, they

that are puffed vp with pride and vaine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, <note place="margin">Vices con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vnto the fruits of loue.</note> as a bladder with winde, they that will commende none, but diſdaine all, they that are not contented with their owne, but ſeek other mens, by deceite or oppreſſion, they that not onely thinke euill, but ſtudy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe miſchiefe<hi>:</hi> they that are ſory to haue truth knowen, &amp; reioyce in iniquitie.

               <p>Laſt of all, S. Paul ſaith, that loue neuer <note place="margin">Verſe 8.</note> falleth away, but abideth with vs in this life, &amp; ſhall continue with vs for euermore in the life to come. O then let vs make much of Loue and charitie, for it is a ſurpaſſing <note place="margin">Loue a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note> treaſure. It is no maruell that Sainte Peter would not finiſhe his Chayne before this lincke of loue were aded vnto it.
